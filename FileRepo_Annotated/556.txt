 FAMILIES have received the biggest lift in household income for two years, official figures are expected to show this week. Economists forecast that average earnings rose by 3.5 per cent in the three months to December while inflation fell to 2.1 per cent in December - the widest gap between the two measures since November 2016. With inflation falling once again in January, down to 1.8 per cent, economists predict that a pick-up in real wage growth could prompt an increase in discretionary spending. Real earnings went into decline in 2017, but started to pick up again last year. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England's chief economist, described the trend as a 'new dawn' for wage growth, speaking in October last year. The wages rises have been partly pinned to record-low levels of unemployment, forcing firms to offer more competitive rates of pay to entice workers. Helen Cahill CREDIT: Helen Cahill
