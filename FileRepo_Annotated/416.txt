 The global economy is hurtling ­towards two of the most potentially severe headwinds in a ­decade, but the incoming chief economist of the European ­Central Bank has urged <loc>Hong Kong</loc> not to panic.
March will see deadlines ­expire for the partial truce in the <loc>US</loc>-<loc>China</loc> trade war and for ­<loc>Britain</loc> to negotiate an orderly exit from the European Union, both of which have the potential to send shock waves through the global economy.
Philip Lane, who was ­endorsed by European finance ministers on Monday to be the next chief economist of the ECB, acknowledged that "that there's been some movement in risk ­towards the downside" in recent weeks.
On the trade war and the mainland's slowdown, however, Lane said during a visit to <loc>Hong Kong</loc> that it would "take a wide imposition of tariffs to have a wide ­impact" on the ­global economy.
"Clearly it's early in 2019, but we have to not overreact to any announcement or data release and take a measured approach to all the data," he said, adding that the integration of the global economy means policymakers the world over are watching the ­outcome of the trade talks.
"The interconnections in the world economy now are so strong. Policy uncertainty is more elevated than normal. A lot depends on how that uncertainty is resolved. It could be upside if there's a favourable policy resolution. If it's ambiguous, or if the direction for the future is unclear, clearly that's negative for investors and sentiment," Lane said.
Tomorrow, vice-ministerial level negotiators from the <loc>US</loc> and <loc>China</loc> will meet in <loc>Beijing</loc> for the next round of talks aimed at ending a trade dispute that has escalated significantly since last July.
On Brexit, Lane said that "it remains more likely a deal" would be agreed between the European Union and the <loc>United Kingdom</loc> ­before the deadline on March 29.
Should a deal not be reached, <loc>Britain</loc> will crash out of the bloc without any agreement on a ­future relationship between it and the European Union.
Lane, who is currently the ­governor of the Central Bank of <loc>Ireland</loc>, added that while the issue of Brexit was a huge concern to the economies of <loc>Ireland</loc>, the EU and <loc>Britain</loc>, it is not an issue that threatens the world economy.
"The <loc>UK</loc> is an important country, but quantitatively it's small - it's not a macro issue. It's important for us in <loc>Ireland</loc>, but at a ­macro level probably less so," he said after a speech at the stock ­exchange.
Despite this, Lane said that should negotiators not reach a deal, then the bloc can still withstand the blow. "Finance is the one area maybe where it was always part of the plan that no matter what happens, hard Brexit, soft Brexit, the financial system would be ready," he said.
"All of the contingency planning has been based on no deal. Firms hope those contingencies won't have to be activated, but ­absent the case, we and other ­regulators have prepared firms to be regulated for no deal."
Brexit and the trade war were also among the issues flagged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this week as part of a brewing "economic storm".
Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director, told the World Government Summit in Dubai on Sunday that risks included "trade tensions and tariff escalations, financial tightening, uncertainty related to the Brexit outcome and spillover impact and an accelerated slowdown of the Chinese economy".
The uncertainty caused in part by Brexit and the trade war caused the IMF to slash its global growth forecasts.
The IMF predicted in January that the world economy will grow at 3.5 per cent this year and 3.6 per cent next year, down 0.2 and 0.1 percentage points, respectively, from its previous outlook.
