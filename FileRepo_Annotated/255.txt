 A senior policymaker at the Bank of <loc>England</loc> has said Brexit could be “downright dangerous” for financial stability and that the institution should not be “neutered” to stop it speaking out on political issues.
Martin Taylor, an external member of the Bank's Financial Policy Committee, which safeguards the <loc>UK</loc>’s financial system, said he was disturbed that Threadneedle Street had been “accused of speaking when it should have remained silent” on Brexit.
He said in a speech at Queens University <loc>Belfast</loc> on Thursday: “The Bank strives to be neutral. That does not mean it should be neutered.”
Brexit had “potential consequences [that] are not merely inconvenient but downright dangerous for financial stability”, Mr Taylor said.
Ppreparation for a Leave vote had been “very sketchy", according to Mr Taylor. “Any future British government deciding to hold a referendum should give serious consideration before the vote takes place to preparing for either outcome.”
The policymaker, who will stand down from his post by June, also drew parallels between the Bank's warnings over Brexit's impact to French commandos being told the Maginot Line would fail in 1939, during the Second World War. This military defence famously only secured the Franco-German border, allowing the allies to be outflanked on the French-Belgian side in 1940.
It comes after the former chief executive of Barclays bank was left “furious” by the media response to the Bank’s so-called scenarios, which detailed how a disorderly Brexit could affect the <loc>UK</loc> economy, according to a source familiar with the matter.
 The controversial scenarios detailed a catastrophic impact on the <loc>UK</loc> economy from leaving the <loc>EU</loc> in disorderly fashion. The Bank said that a no deal Brexit could wipe 8pc off economic output within a year, the worst downturn since the Second World War. Residential property prices could tumble by as much as 30pc and commercial property by 48pc, it concluded.
A senior economist familiar with operations at the Bank told The Telegraph that it lacked sufficient expertise and modelling capabilities at to quantify how property prices could be affected by a no deal Brexit and as a result these numbers were “not credible”.
 The economist did, however, support the view that the Bank was right to sound the alarm about the wider negative economic impact of leaving the <loc>EU</loc> without a transition period and a final deal.
Internal tensions at the Bank were revealed in meeting minutes, first reported by the Telegraph, which showed policymakers’ concerns that releasing the Brexit scenarios could be “misleading” and “against the public interest”.
Further disagreements were hinted at in Mr Taylor’s speech over the idea that faith could be lost in the Bank as a institution under its own scenario.
He said: “The disorderly scenario actually supposes investors call into question the credibility of the <loc>UK</loc>’s macroeconomic framework and institutions - of which the Bank of <loc>England</loc> of course is one - a conclusion other parts of the Bank of <loc>England</loc> can hardly be expected to embrace.
“It is rather as if French commandos in 1939 had disseminated a paper suggesting that the Maginot Line might prove ineffective.”
Mr Taylor also stated in his speech that the Bank had been forced by MPs to produce the Brexit scenarios.
"All of this [Brexit scenario work] has been done quietly and discreetly, with repeated heavy redaction of meeting records, in order to avoid the appearance of political interference by the Bank," he said.
"The most recent modelled scenarios were eventually published because the Treasury Select Committee demanded to see them. They subsequently found their way - along with all the now unredacted text - into the public domain via the December 2018 Financial Stability Report."
However, parliamentary sources told The Telegraph when the scenarios were first published that MPs had made no more than a “friendly request” in their call for bespoke analysis.
