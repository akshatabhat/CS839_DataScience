 Santiniketan: Nobel laureate Amartya Sen feels prim-ary education and primary healthcare have not got the desired attention in India.
"Primary healthcare in our country didn't see the desired improvement when people all over the world are discussing ways to improve it. I don't know if Pakistan has spared a thought to this sector. But Bangladesh did and has also achieved a lot," said the economist and chairman of Pratichi Trust. He was speaking here on Friday on the role of teachers and health workers in improving health services.
The Centre's much-touted Ayushman Bharat scheme, too, has not impressed Sen. "The Centre is taking some populist measures and drawing up schemes that bare their narrow thought process. The Ayushman project doesn't strengthen primary health service and management," he said.
Drawing a parallel with China's health system, Sen said: "China may have to take a lesson or two on democracy from us, but there is no doubt China is far ahead of India in primary healthcare, education and has a robust economy. China can produce more things than we do because it has a skilled workforce and an educated manpower to oversee quality control. Health and education are the two major sources of China's doing better."
On the benefits or otherwise of a universal basic income scheme, Sen said: "Putting money in a person's pocket is not so important because it doesn't do away with the poor condition of primary healthcare. Those who can afford can avail better health services. But that doesn't strengthen the health system."
"Some may feel that privatisation is the way to development. But premature privatisation is a wrong concept," he added. The economist, however, didn't go into the specifics of the central health scheme or the Swastha Sathi scheme run by the West Bengal government.
