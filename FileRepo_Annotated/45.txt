 A global recession is coming . That much is certain. To make this prediction is, however, only to state the obvious; it is no more insightful than saying that summer will eventually give way to winter. The real question is that of timing, for nobody believes any longer in fantasy notions such as the death of the business cycle. The sell-off that occurred in markets from the late summer of last year onwards, and a slowing global economy since then, seemed to indicate it was coming sooner rather than later.
Yet that moment of immediate danger appears to have passed. In the face of recessionary fears, we’ve seen policy capitulation, both by the Federal Reserve in the <loc>United States</loc>, which has all but given up on attempts to get official interest rates back to a semblance of normality, and in <loc>China</loc>, which has likewise partially abandoned its efforts to contain explosive credit growth. It can only be a matter of time before the European Central Bank similarly reverses its policy stance.
Business cycles don’t just die of old age, the <loc>US</loc> economist Rudi Dornbusch used to be fond of saying; rather they are murdered by the actions of the Federal Reserve. By ramping up the cost of debt, the Fed was showing every sign of just such a killing, but then, with the therapy beginning to work rather too well, it lost its nerve. Similarly in <loc>China</loc>, where the clampdown on credit was causing the economy to slow far more rapidly than anticipated. Since then, President Xi Jinping has backed off. He has also sought to defuse the economically debilitating trade war with the <loc>US</loc> .

But what is also true is that we are very much due a global recession . For the <loc>US</loc>, the current, near-10-year expansion is already one of the longest on record. There is no god-given rule that says we must have a recession at least every 10 years, but that seems to be the general way of things. As the good times roll, the complacencies and pathologies build until eventually they bring the cycle to an abrupt end.
All the same, policy reversal may have given this long expansionary phase a new lease of life.
Global recessions are nearly always preceded by an oil price spike which, by making energy costs more expensive, acts to take money out of people’s pockets and depress demand. We saw signs of that last summer, but since then, the oil price has come right back down again.
As one of the world’s most open economies, the <loc>UK</loc> is particularly vulnerable to the international weather. We rarely escape recessions born in either the <loc>US</loc> or <loc>Europe</loc>. But parking the Brexit shambles for the moment, it is actually quite hard to see why the <loc>UK</loc> economy should suffer an outright economic contraction any time soon.
Employment is still growing, and with inflation falling, we are even starting to see some real wage growth. Higher tax thresholds will put more money still in people’s pockets. Unless there is a sudden collapse in consumer confidence, then, the demand side of the economy, though scarcely buoyant, ought to hold up.
  All bets are of course off in the event of a disruptive, no-deal Brexit, but even then, there is some reason to believe the rest of the <loc>EU</loc> might actually be rather worse affected than us. It’s not just the fragility of the European economy, in aggregate already closer to recession than almost anywhere else. We think of <loc>Britain</loc> as in a state of profound political crisis, but the position scarcely looks better across the water. It’s a political tinderbox that could blow apart at any stage.
Eurozone economic slowdown might not be a blip, ECB chief economist fears
  The eurozone debt crisis has been in remission for some years now, but a bad Brexit may be all that’s required to bring it roaring back. In a rational world, the <loc>EU</loc> would agree an accommodative deal with the <loc>UK</loc>, but determination to defend the single market’s integrity at all costs - otherwise known as cutting off your nose to spite your face - is the order of the day. There is no guarantee negotiators will see sense.
The other big threat comes from <loc>China</loc>, now one of the great engine rooms of the global economy. <loc>China</loc> is widely thought of as a closed, substantially export-based economy, but in fact it has become far more widely integrated into international commerce than is generally appreciated. Recent research has shown the rest of the world to be rather more exposed to <loc>China</loc> than <loc>China</loc> is to the rest of the world.
Westerners have been predicting economic catastrophe in <loc>China</loc>, highly dependent on debt-fuelled infrastructure and business investment as it is, for donkey’s years; one day they will be right. And because <loc>China</loc> has become so internationally integrated, its slowdown is already hitting other economies hard.
Dornbusch was good with his soundbites. Here’s another: “In economics, things take longer to happen than you think they will, and then they happen faster than you thought they could.” Another global recession? Yes obviously, but possibly not for another year or two.
