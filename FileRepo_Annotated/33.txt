 <loc>Italy</loc> has fallen back into recession while growth across the eurozone has slowed to a five-year low, raising fresh concerns about the waning economic health of the currency bloc. A contraction of 0.2 per cent between October and December confirmed that <loc>Rome</loc>'s populist government is presiding over the country's third recession in a decade. The economy shrank 0.1 per cent in the previous three months, making it two quarters running, the technical definition of a recession. The downturn in the eurozone's third largest economy comes as a blow to the region, which is struggling once again. Growth across the 19 member states was only 0.2 per cent in the final quarter. The year-on-year growth rate of 1.2 per cent was the weakest in five years. Bert Colijn, senior economist at ING, said: "Hopes of a swift bounceback after the poor third quarter had already faded, but the 0.2 per cent growth in GDP remains disappointing nevertheless," The eurozone's reversal of fortune has been swift. Growth for 2018 as a whole, recorded at 1.8 per cent yesterday, followed three years in which it was 2 per cent or above. The International Monetary Fund has forecast it to slow again to 1.6 per cent this year. The weakness is not confined to <loc>Italy</loc>. Growth in <loc>Germany</loc> is also slowing. Although fourth quarter German figures have yet to be published, <loc>Berlin</loc> has already cut its growth forecast to 1 per cent this year and is facing calls for stimulus to support the economy. Changes to car emissions standards, have hurt German exports, but Fabio Balboni, HSBC's European economist, warned that the whole region was facing a broader setback "due to the weakness in global trade ... poor retail sales [and] falling consumer confidence". <loc>France</loc> posted growth of 0.3 per cent thanks to strong exports but domestic consumption was flat. <loc>Spain</loc> was the bright spot, beating expectations with solid 0.7 per cent quarterly growth. The eurozone's poor performance is likely to worry the European Central Bank, which is now expected to lower its 1.7 per cent forecast for 2019 and may struggle to raise interest rates this year. Unemployment in the eurozone remained at 7.9 per cent, the equal-lowest rate in more than ten years. Joblessness fell slightly in <loc>Italy</loc> and <loc>Spain</loc>, which still have the highest unemployment levels after <loc>Greece</loc>. In the whole eurozone, 75,000 fewer people were out of work than in November. CREDIT: Philip Aldrick Economics Editor
