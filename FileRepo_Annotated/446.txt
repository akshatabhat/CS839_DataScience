Deutsche Bank is expecting the same 0.2 percent contraction to start off 2019. A recession normally results from two consecutive quarters of economic decline.
The bank added in its note: "Given much weaker than expected January business surveys and in particular the slump in their more forward looking components we are now expecting the German economy to contract again in Q1 2019.
"Global economic policy uncertainty jumped in December marking a new all-time high.”
"Most of the global trouble spots have taken a turn for the worse in January, making it very hard to assume a fundamental improvement during the reminder of Q1."
