 <loc>India</loc>'s economy expanded at a much faster rate than initially estimated in the last two fiscal years, according to revised numbers released by the government, which show that growth remained high despite disruptions from demonetisation and the rollout of goods and services tax.
The statistics office on Thursday revised the growth rate for <loc>India</loc>'s gross domestic product for fiscal 2017 to 8.2% from the 7.1% reported earlier. The government had announced demonetisation on November 8, 2016, partly impacting the fiscal year through March 2017.
The growth estimate for fiscal 2018, the first full year after demonetisation and which also included the first nine months of GST, was raised to 7.2% from 6.7% in the first revised estimates for FY18. The data indicate a sharper slowdown between the two years than estimated earlier. The gap widened to a full percentage point from 0.4 percentage point earlier.
