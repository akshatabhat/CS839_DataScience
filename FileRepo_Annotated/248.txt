 ON TUESDAY, Business Day writer at large Carol Paton tweeted: "I see our (sic) friends at Independent Newspapers are calling for Mondli Gungubele to go. Here is why he shouldn't", in yet another unprovoked attack on Independent Media.
In another tweet, she further cocked a snook at "commentators" brazenly telling analysts (most of whom are black, by the way) with PhDs and economists to familiarise themselves with "the facts" before opening their mouths.
It is fascinating how, in 2019, some leading journalists and their media houses in <loc>South <loc>Africa</loc></loc> have taken it upon themselves to come out and defend politicians who are implicated in corruption scandals where billions of rand have been looted at the Public Investment Corporation (PIC).
<loc>South <loc>Africa</loc></loc> has undoubtedly entered an era of embedded "agenda setting" journalism, where media houses are now providing reputation management services for their favourite politicians to go on media tours in an effort to clear their names when facing corruption allegations.
In the article, titled: "Resignation of PIC board provides a clean slate for future", Paton claims that allegations against Gungubele "amount to naive errors of judgment or a less innocent attempt to protect people suspected of corruption in the PIC. In no way, though, do his actions in and of themselves amount to corruption or wrongdoing. They do not raise the question of whether he should step aside as deputy minister."
She further states that: "It is unfortunate that Gungubele got tangled in this mess"
The reality is that Gungubele is alleged to be involved in an intricate web of corruption, cronyism and a nepotism patronage network involving board member Sibusisiwe Zulu - Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Minister Zweli Mkhize's niece - and her live-in lover Lawrence Mulaudzi.
