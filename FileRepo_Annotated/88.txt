 Another bumper jobs report in <loc>America</loc> yesterday secured a record 100th consecutive month of rising employment and signalled that the economy is on a stronger footing than many had thought. Non-farm payrolls expanded by 304,000 jobs in January, the most in 11 months and significantly more than the 165,000 gain forecast by economists. The figure was published in the Department of Labor's monthly employment report, regarded as a gauge of the health of the <loc>US</loc> economy. However, the report is likely to be a headache for Jerome Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve, who indicated on Wednesday that it would hold off on plans to raise interest rates this year. When employment is at or near capacity, it is a sign that a central bank needs to raise rates to head off rising inflation. The report was not without its downsides. Wage growth climbed by only 0.1 per cent month-on-month in January, compared with the 0.3 per cent forecast by economists and the 0.4 per cent reported in December. Payroll gains in December were revised down markedly from 312,000 to 222,000. The unemployment rate edged up to 4 per cent in January from 3.9 per cent the month before, although the level is still very low. A sell-off on Wall Street in December had raised fears that the <loc>US</loc> economy was on the brink of a slowdown. Andrew Hunter, senior <loc>US</loc> economist at Capital Economics, said: "If employment growth remains this strong, there is still a fair chance of one more rate hike in the first half of this year." In <loc>New <loc>York</loc></loc> last night the S&P 500 closed up 0.1 per cent, or 2.43 points, to 2,706.53. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 64.22 points, or 0.3 per cent, at 25,063.89, giving it a weekly gain of 1.3 per cent, and the technologyfocused Nasdaq index was down 0.3 per cent, or 17.87 points, at 7,263.87.
