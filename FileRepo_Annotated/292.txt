 Theresa May has lost her way but fears of devastating <loc>US</loc>-<loc>China</loc> fallout may be overblown Trade policy has been a news­worthy subject for commentators at large in <loc>Europe</loc>, <loc>North <loc>America</loc></loc> and <loc>Asia</loc> since Donald Trump’s election and the Brexit referendum in <loc>Britain</loc>. It remains so. The general consequence is the constant question: Is the global trading system under threat?
Trump’s clumsy plans to turn <loc>US</loc> policy on its head and Theresa May’s inability to turn British policy in any direction to implement Brexit offer journalists and analysts plenty of scope for comment.
<loc>Australia</loc> has chosen its own peculiar bent. Under Julie Bishop as foreign minister, the priorities on the foreign affairs side of the ­Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade broadly focused on political military (pol-mil) affairs. Given concern about political relations with <loc>China</loc> and tensions in the <loc>South <loc>China</loc></loc> Sea, senior Chinese officials refused to meet Australian ministers for about a year.
On the trade side, the relationship appears to be more business as usual. <loc>China</loc> is <loc>Australia</loc>’s biggest trading partner, taking 60 per cent of our exports.
Trump brought an eccentric trade policy to his presidency. The only acceptable trade agreements had to deliver a balanced trade ledger surplus to the <loc>US</loc>. He scotched <loc>US</loc> engagement in the Trans-<loc>Pacific</loc> Partnership free trade agreement that had been largely driven by the Obama administration. He initially ­opposed renewal of the North American Free Trade Agreement. And he raised tariffs on steel imports to promote jobs in the <loc>US</loc> steel industry — to the detriment of much larger steel-consuming industries.
Economists at large were ­initially perturbed by these deviations from traditional free-market trade policy. Two years on, Trump’s trade policy is becoming more moderate. The major issue now is trade with <loc>China</loc>.
The particular dismay for <loc>Australia</loc> and other <loc>Asia</loc>-<loc>Pacific</loc> trading economies was the sidelining by the President of the TPP. ­Regardless, the remaining 11 <loc>Asia</loc>-<loc>Pacific</loc> economies, led by <loc>Japan</loc> and <loc>Australia</loc>, reshaped the agreement as the Comprehensive and Progressive TPP. The agreement is in effect for seven of the participating countries. There’s an open invitation for the <loc>US</loc> to rejoin, but this remains off the agenda for Trump’s current term of office.
