 Meanwhile, <loc>Scotland's</loc> chief economist, Gary Gillespie, claimed a no-deal Brexit could lead to a "major dislocation" to the Scottish economy.
So therefore Blackford's clapping seals down at <loc>Westminster</loc> must, by implication, vote for the deal when it is represented to parliament? Max Mad the Pavement Warrior Project Fear, YAWN!
Ian Beale Did anyone notice the use of the word "could"? Whilst it is only right that economists highlight risks, it is for politicians to work to mitigate those risks. The SNP strategy of voting against the withdrawal agreement the <loc>EU</loc> has signed off and said is the best and only deal "..in the hope an alternative will emerge" has be shown to be a dereliction of duty, as has the SNP's entire Brexit strategy.
Roastin The Ford Motor Company, which employs 12,700 workers at sites across <loc>England</loc> and <loc>Wales</loc>, has [just] warned the Conservative government that there will be "dire consequences" if there is a disorderly No Deal. Ford has warned May that 7,000 factory jobs will go, and its parent company in the <loc>United States</loc> will consider relocating elsewhere "to preserve the competitiveness of its European business". Yet, Brexiteeers are still in denial? Samuel Coldstream Why is the SNP so quick to believe what this economist says, and yet will not accept the findings of its own Growth Commission Report? SNP's views on Brexit - "chaos, cliff-edge, disaster, catastrophe" etc. SNP's views on Scottish independence - "wonderful, progressive, inclusive, caring, fantastic" etc. They are so hypocritical, it's unreal.
