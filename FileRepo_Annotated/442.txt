The FTSE 100 has hit a four-month high after global stocks were propelled higher by signs that Donald Trump is softening his stance in the trade war with <loc>China</loc>.
Mr Trump admitted that he could extend a crucial trade talks deadline in early March to help secure a deal with <loc>Beijing</loc>. Tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods will be automatically hiked on March 2 without a deal.
Led higher by its climbing mining and packaging stocks, the FTSE 100 advanced 0.8pc but fell short of closing above the 7,200 mark.
<loc>US</loc> stocks later gave up some of their strong gains after <loc>US</loc> Republican Senator Marco Rubio unveiled a bill to tax share buybacks like dividends in a bid to redirect investment back into the economy. Mr Rubio said that the rule change would drive investment into "productivity" and "jobs". The Dow Jones pulled back to a 0.2pc gain after advancing 0.8pc in early trade.

The company has now booked £71m of costs in relation to the so-called Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route, which has been plagued by delays and cost over-runs and is still yet to fully open.
Peter Truscott, chief executive, said: “It’s effectively finished - the civil servants and lawyers and still dotting the i’s and crossing t’s to get the thing open to the public, but it is physically complete.”

Markets Hub I FTSE 10011:22AMWhy a cheaper pound is not always a good thing
A cheaper pound will boost exports. This is the mantra that is often repeated by those arguing a drop in the value of sterling is not a problem and might, in fact, benefit the <loc>UK</loc> economy. Recent political events have tested this theory and found it wanting.
Why is a cheap pound not necessarily a good thing? The answer boils down to what it is that gives a currency value in the first place.

10:54AMPound shrugs off slide in inflation
January's CPI inflation rate of 1.8% probably is as good as it will get for consumers this year. A big 10% rise in the cap on elec. & gas SVTs will boost the headline rate by 0.3pp in April. And a further fall in goods inflation likely will be offset by rising services inflation pic.twitter.com/fTAwgmVYE6

The pound has largely shrugged off this morning's fall in inflation knocking rate rise hopes.
Sterling is flat versus the dollar and euro at $1.2885 and [Euro]1.1384, respectively.
Inflation sinking below the Bank of <loc>England</loc>'s 2pc target rate does not end hopes of a post-Brexit hike, according to Pantheon Macro economist Samuel Tombs.
He explained that past experience indicates that "low inflation won’t stop the Monetary Policy Committee from raising the Bank Rate later this year, if, as we expect, the economy regains some momentum following relief that a no-deal Brexit has been averted".

New Look’s turnaround efforts are beginning to deliver as the fashion chain returned to profit and posted an encouraging improvement in sales.
The clothing retailer, which last year announced a radical store closure programme and a debt-for-equity swap in January, said the focus remained on improving its “operational and financial stability amid the challenging retail environment”.
Sales fell 5pc over the the nine months to Dec 22, but New Look revealed that like-for-like sales in the last quarter were down by just 2.3pc, compared to the steep 10.7pc it reported a year earlier. In the <loc>UK</loc>, New Look’s performance was even better, with sales rising by 0.9pc.

Sinking inflation is "riding to the rescue of the <loc>UK</loc> consumer" and shoppers could hit the high street again when Brexit uncertainty lifts, according to Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte.
"Together with rising earnings it is delivering a powerful uplift to spending power," he added.
Will the economy be given a much-needed boost by consumers unleashing their new-found spending power when the Brexit fog finally lifts?

Welcome news for <loc>UK</loc> real pay growth prospects, as <loc>UK</loc> CPI inflation fell to 1.8%y/y in January, with the core measure (that excludes food & fuel) steady at 1.9%y/y.

After suffering a year-long squeeze following the Brexit vote, household incomes have been bolstered in recent months by inflation and wage growth moving in different directions.
Price rises have now slipped to a two-year low while wage growth has surged to 3.4pc, a 10-year high.
Inflation was dragged down in January by falling electricity and gas prices, according to ONS. It added that that downward push was partially offset by air fares.
9:37AMReal wages boosted by inflation sinking below Bank of <loc>England</loc>'s 2pc target for first time in two years
Inflation has slipped below the Bank of <loc>England</loc>'s 2pc target for the first time in two years, marking the end of a surge in prices caused by sterling's slump.
The pressure on real wages eased further in January after CPI sank to 1.8pc. The drop in inflation to below the Bank's target rate will knock hopes that its policymakers will lift interest rates after Brexit.
9:14AMWith the eurozone economy slowing, whoever heads its central bank will have a tough task ahead of them
And they are off. It may seem too early for the starting gun on runners and riders to succeed Mario Draghi as president of the European Central Bank, but he is leaving in November, and in order to give reasonable notice, a successor has to be announced by July at the latest.
As in most things European, it is a complicated business. Each eurozone member state puts forward a candidate; finance ministers then decide collectively on who to support before handing the matter over to national premiers formally to decide. As yet, there is therefore no obvious front runner.
Worryingly for such an important post, the best man for the job doesn’t necessarily get it. The outcome depends crucially on the wider divvying up among member states of senior European positions.

8:40AMAgenda: FTSE 100 rally extends into third day after Trump hints at extension to tariffs ceasefire with <loc>China</loc>
The FTSE 100's rally has entered a third day after Donald Trump revealed that he could extend a crucial deadline in <loc>US</loc>-<loc>China</loc> trade talks to secure a "real deal".
<loc>US</loc> tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods are set to be automatically hiked on March 2 at the end of a 90-day ceasefire in the trade war but Donald Trump said that he could let the deadline "slide for a little while" if a deal with <loc>Beijing</loc> is close.
“But generally speaking I’m not inclined” to agreeing to a delay, Mr Trump warned. The <loc>US</loc> president spooked markets last week by admitting that he would not be able to meet with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping before the deadline, stoking fears that fresh tariffs could weigh on already slowing global growth.
Asian and European markets took their lead from strong trading on Wall Street overnight after the <loc>US</loc> president signalled a delay to the tariffs. The FTSE 100 rallied 0.5pc in early trade to near a four-month high while eurozone blue-chip stocks climbed 0.4pc.
