 The SNP could propose an "alternative form of independence" in a second referendum campaign to offset public fears surrounding the Brexit turmoil, a top academic suggested. It could see <loc>Scotland</loc> remain in a "British Union" while also signing to the European single market, according to economist Professor John McLaren.
A "British Union"? Is that not what we have at the moment? Or is it, as I suspect, independence but we still get Barnett. LOL!
choccywoccydoda I'm a Brexiteer because much as I like the economic union for which I voted, I wish to leave the encroaching political union for which none of us have ever voted.
Andy Mac Thank you. In one sentence you have articulated the entire reason why so many of us voted Leave.
slowman This "economist" seems blissfully unaware that the Seps utterly detest anything described as "British". Sad and unexplainable to any rational person, but nevertheless it's the sad truth.
  David Kilpatrick The SNP are irrelevant to the needs of the people of <loc>Scotland</loc>. And besides that, inside or outside the <loc>EU,</loc> <loc>Scotland</loc> needs the infrastructure in <loc>England</loc> to access European markets, an access that it already has.
   World wide Football fan Different but not sure the <loc>EU</loc> would be up for this.. Irish border issue all over again. Begs the question though why not just stay in the "British Union" we are all ready in
