 <loc>VENEZUELA</loc> is in the grips of a Presidential crisis, with two politicians vying for power and countries around the world weighing in on the debate. Why has Nicolas Maduro’s government failed Venezuelans?
Incumbent President of <loc>Venezuela</loc> Nicolas Maduro was proclaimed the winner of the 2018 presidential election but then stripped of his victory by the National Assembly of <loc>Venezuela</loc> who declared the results of the election invalid. Opposition leader Juan Guaido was then declared interim president, and countries around the world have been split on who to support. There are calls for another election and the <loc>US</loc> have even gone as far as imposing sanctions on the South American country.

 From next week, European Union governments will move to recognise Juan Guaido as <loc>Venezuela</loc>'s interim president but will do so using cautious language for fear of setting a precedent for political crises, two <loc>EU</loc> diplomats said on Friday.
<loc>Britain</loc>, <loc>France</loc>, <loc>Germany</loc> and <loc>Spain</loc> are expected to announce their direct recognition of Guaido from Monday, assuming an eight-day deadline they set last Saturday for an election is not met, diplomats said.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has dismissed the call as an unacceptable ultimatum.
Nicolas Maduro was first elected as <loc>Venezuela</loc>’s President in April 2013 and has largely relied on the military to maintain his power.
A 2014 Gallup poll found that 75 percent of Venezuelans believed corruption was widespread throughout the government, and corruption was one of the reasons given for both the 2014 and 2017 Venezuelan protests.

<loc>Venezuela</loc> CRISIS: How has Maduro impacted <loc>Venezuela</loc> during his presidency?
In the Americas, <loc>Venezuela</loc> is the bottom of Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index.
<loc>Venezuela</loc> was graded 18/100 “reflecting systemic and persistent corruption across the country”.
Whilst <loc>Canada</loc> tops the Corruption Perceptions Index, with 81/100 and the <loc>USA</loc> follows on 71/80.
The reason for low scores across <loc>Venezuela</loc> and indeed much of the Americas is there is a rise in some leaders and leadership styles which favour these tactics:
an undermining of free and independent media, especially when coverage challenges leaders’ messaginga silencing and control of civil society and international organisationsan increase in voter suppression and disenfranchisementan increase in anti-immigrant, anti-LGBT, anti-indigenous and racist languagea rise in public promises for simplistic and “strong hand” approaches to solving deep-rooted and complex societal problems, including corruptionan interference with or blunt use of national institutions to weaken the system of checks and balances and increase executive poweran increase in conflicts of interest and private influence

Mauro was voted Person of the Year in 2016 by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project for being “the individual who has done the most in the world to advance organised criminal activity and corruption".
The OCCRP stated they “chose Maduro for the global award on the strength of his corrupt and oppressive reign, so rife with mismanagement that citizens of his oil-rich nation are literally starving and begging for medicines”.
Maduro and his family have been accused of stealing millions of dollars from the government to fund backing which keeps his power in <loc>Venezuela</loc>.
The OCCRP editor and one of the judges for the Person of the Year award Drew Sullivan said in 2016: “It’s been a big year for Maduro.
“I think this year has been the tipping point and his negligence, incompetence and corruption are the cause.

“When a country’s leader can watch his people starve and still oversee a government stealing $70 billion a year all while his family deals drugs, it’s a special kind of evil. He deserves this prize.”
Commenting on the situation in <loc>Venezuela</loc>, Fernando Freijedo, an analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit told Express.co.uk:
“As of the moment of writing, neither the Venezuelan government nor PDVSA has responded beyond calling the <loc>US</loc> announcements part of an attempted coup.
“The fact that there has been such a delay in announcing palliative measures is both typical of the Maduro's regime incompetence and a bad sign for the regime's internal stability.
“The gamble is a bold one as the <loc>US</loc> has played its strongest card and is now seemingly out of non-military options on <loc>Venezuela</loc>.

“We had expected the <loc>US</loc> to work its way up to sanctions as a form of building pressure within the regime. Mr Bolton once again said, in reference to military intervention, that "all options are on the table".
“However, the use of military force continues to seem unlikely as it would almost surely come with costs in terms of legitimacy for the <loc>US</loc> and the opposition.
“<loc>Russia</loc>, but more importantly <loc>China</loc>, remain wildcards. Both countries could potentially offer loans, and trade opportunities to replace those blocked by the <loc>US</loc>'s actions."
However, Mr Freijedo said he does "not expect either country to fully commit to prop-up the Maduro regime.”

This is because: “We see <loc>China</loc> unwilling to heavily bet against the <loc>US</loc> and risk souring relations in the midst of trade negotiations. Similarly, we see <loc>Russia</loc> as more interested in dealing with its own sanctions and, unlike <loc>China</loc>, financially unable to bankroll the Venezuelan regime.
“There have been no high-ranking defections inside of <loc>Venezuela</loc>. However, there are numerous anecdotal reports that the rank-and-file and lower-level officers in both armed forces and the gendarmerie are unhappy at the deteriorating living conditions and increasingly reticent to repress the citizenry.
“This breakdown in command, coupled with the loss of revenue from exports, is the opposition's main hopes of inciting a fracture inside the regime.
“The Venezuelan political situation is at a crucial stage. The opposition has made significant advances in key areas needed to maximise its chances of fracturing the regime. The coming days, with the regime's response and the opposition's show of public support, will show if the regime's internal stability will hold.“
