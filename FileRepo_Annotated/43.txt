 Northwestern University named Francesca Cornelli as the new dean of its Kellogg School of Management, taking over the M.B.A. program.
The economist will join the business school in August before the fall 2019 term begins. Ms. Cornelli is currently deputy dean at <loc>London</loc> Business School, where she has worked for the past 25 years while teaching finance.
She replaces Sally Blount, the first woman to lead a top-ranked business school in the <loc>U.S.</loc>, who stepped down from her post last year. Kathleen Hagerty served as Kellogg's interim dean since September 2018.
Northwestern Provost Jonathan Holloway called Ms. Cornelli "an exceptional leader and talented scholar who is committed to fostering excellence for faculty, staff and students." She sits on the editorial board of multiple academic journals, including the Review of Financial Studies, and is known for her research on corporate governance, private equity and corporate innovation.
"Her enthusiasm for Kellogg, proven track record of collaboration and clear-eyed focus on the future made her the obvious choice," he said.
Ms. Blount's decision to step down as dean and return to teaching full time at Kellogg was notable because male business schools deans outnumber females with the top job three to one. In 2018, 77% of American business school deans were male, while 23% were female, according to a survey of 670 schools conducted by accrediting agency Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. The association found that 19.5% of deans were female in 2014, the previous year data was available.
Even though women earn three of every five graduate degrees awarded across all disciplines in the <loc>U.S.</loc>, business school students still skew 54% male, according to the latest Education Department data.
Ms. Blount helped Kellogg raise $365 million from alumni donations and gifts during her eight-year tenure as dean and oversaw the development of its new $250 million, 415,000-square-foot campus in Evanston, Ill.
Kellogg has said it is working to change the balance of women and racial minorities in its programs. In the fall, a record 46% of students enrolled in its full-time M.B.A. program were women and 27% of that class were <loc>U.S.</loc> minorities, the school said.
