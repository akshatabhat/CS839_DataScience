 <loc>UK</loc> FACTORIES are stockpiling goods more quickly than ever before as they brace for Brexit disruption despite the manufacturing sector being at a point of "near-stagnation", according to new figures published yesterday.
There has been increasing anecdotal evidence that companies are creating buffers as the March 29 Brexit deadline draws closer. On Thursday, Unilever said it had hired special refrigeration units to stockpile Magnums and Ben & Jerry's ice cream. But the effort now appears to have become more widespread, as companies worry about the disruption to their supply chains.
In January, inventories grew at the fastest rate in 27 years of surveys, according to the purchasing managers index, compiled by IHS Markit.
But economists and trade experts warned that there is only so much that many businesses can do. At the World Economic Forum in <loc>Davos</loc> last month, Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of <loc>England</loc>, said there was only a "limited amount" that businesses could do to prepare for a hard Brexit as manufacturing companies "can't stack things all over Wales" to ensure they have the parts needed to overcome any supply disruption. "There are a series of logistical problems that need to be solved and it's quite transparent that they're not," he said.
The IHS survey also showed that business optimism has sunk to a 30-month low, as poor figures from the major eurozone economies and uncertainty over Brexit weighed on outlook. Jobs were also lost in the manufacturing sector last month - the first cuts in headcount since the immediate aftermath of the referendum result.
Rob Dobson, at IHS Markit, said that poor economic performance from continental neighbours and political concerns meant there was "a clear risk of manufacturing sliding into recession".
The overall score for <loc>UK</loc> factories, on a scale where any number above 50 indicates growth, was 52.8, a threemonth low. This was worse than expected by economists, whose average forecast was 53.5 - considerably closer to December's figure of 54.2.
James Knightley, of ING, said that, as both order and output for factories slowed, any sign of positive growth was almost certainly due to the levels of stockpiling.
Other economists agreed that the growth indicated by the headline figure was due to inventories being built up rather than output rising.
Samuel Tombs, of Pantheon Macro-Economics, said: "Contingency planning for a no-deal Brexit is providing only limited support to manufacturers at a time of weakening underlying demand, both in the domestic and export markets."
While the <loc>UK</loc>'s figures might have been better than those for the eurozone, which fell for the third consecutive month, this was also only a result of Brexit preparations, he added.
 Stockpiling was expected to continue in the weeks before the deadline to exit the <loc>EU,</loc> as political deadlock in Westminster persists.
Duncan Brock, of the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, said that there would be "significant challenges ahead" for <loc>UK</loc> factories.
Data showed that delivery times of raw materials to factories had lengthened for the 33rd month in a row. These had been exacerbated by the increased stockpiling demand.
As a result, supply chains were already close to "breaking point" and there remained significant doubt as to how firms could "retain stocks for every eventuality", Mr Brock added.
