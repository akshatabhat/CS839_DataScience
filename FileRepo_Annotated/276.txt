 It has been a long time since professional sports produced a twisted situation with as much at stake as what's happening in the NBA right now. A team with a superstar player under contract through the end of next season stands to benefit by telling him not to bother coming to work.
Anthony Davis publicly requested a trade. The <loc>New Orleans</loc> Pelicans decided against dealing him before this week's trade deadline. Now the most absurd outcome is their optimal scenario: They're better off not playing their best player.
It's irrationally rational. Their $25 million employee is more valuable to them on the bench than on the court.
"Davis and the Pelicans are going to get negative utility from every game that he plays," said Purdue University economist Timothy Bond. "It is really strange."
The Pelicans have already made it clear the idea is too strange for them. Not playing Davis proved to be easier in theory than the cold, awkward world of reality, and they said on Thursday they plan to honor the wishes of their franchise player by keeping Davis in the lineup for the rest of the season.
It might have been impossible for them to get away with such a drastic approach even if they'd tried. The backlash from other players, agents, fans, the union and the league office would have been ferocious. The NBA is an entertainment business that's richer than ever because of billion-dollar television contracts and paying fans who prefer to watch basketball players actually playing basketball.
"The Pelicans want to preserve the integrity of the game and align our organization with NBA policies," <loc>New Orleans</loc> general manager Dell Demps said in a statement released by the team. "We believe Anthony playing upholds the values that are in the best interest of the NBA and its fans."
But is that the smartest course of action for the Pelicans?
They found themselves in this basketball limbo when Davis asked for a trade last week, with almost 18 months left on his contract, making it known that not even a lifetime supply of beignets would keep him in <loc>New Orleans</loc>. His demand put an enormous amount of pressure on the Pelicans to dump the 25-year-old player with generational talent in the prime of his career. The rest of the league reacted appropriately: by freaking out for the next 10 days.
The <loc>Los Angeles</loc> Lakers reportedly offered everything but LeBron James and the statues outside their arena for Davis, but the Pelicans resisted their overtures long enough to get past Thursday's trade deadline. Now they have no choice but to deal him this summer instead of letting him walk and losing him for nothing.
