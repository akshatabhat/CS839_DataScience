 THE economic crisis engulfing the eurozone is threatening the growth of the global economy, with the deepening struggles in <loc>Italy</loc> and <loc>Germany</loc> driving the bloc into a debt disaster, experts have warned.
Last week, eurozone growth forecasts were slashed by the European Commission as fears continue to intensify over the bloc's biggest economies. In its latest quarterly forecasts, the Commission warned eurozone growth will slow to 1.3 percent this year from 1.9 percent in 2018. Growth is expected to rebound slightly to 1.6 percent in 2020, but alarm bells will be ringing as the new estimates are less optimistic than the Commission’s previous forecasts.

Desmond Lachman, former Deputy Director in the IMF’s Policy Development and Review Department, warned if the Italian government can’t repair the damage quickly, the world should brace itself for a huge debt crisis.
He told the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum: “With public debt at around 130 percent of GDP, the economy must grow if investors are to be persuaded that the country's finances are sustainable. This is crucial for the Italian government now that its gross borrowing needs are close to a staggering $275billion a year.

“Stuck within the euro straitjacket, the Italian government lacks the macroeconomic tools for stimulating the economy.
“As part of a single currency, it is the European Central Bank - not the Banca d'Italia - which manages <loc>Italy</loc>'s interest rate and exchange rate policy.
Mr Lachman added: “All of this is of the utmost concern for the global economy. The Italian economy is around 10 times the size of <loc>Greece</loc>'s and it has a government debt in excess of $2.5trillion.
“In addition, it has a populist government whose economic policies are at odds with those of its European partners. That will make it all the more difficult for the Italian government to obtain a bail-out package if investor appetite for its debt evaporates.
“Hopefully the Italian government will heed the early warning signs coming out of the market and start seriously reforming the economy. If not, the world should brace itself for another, more vicious round of the European sovereign debt crisis.”
