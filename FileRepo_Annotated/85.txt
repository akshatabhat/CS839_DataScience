 New car sales in <loc>Ireland</loc> are at risk of dropping by more than 15,000 this year, an economist has warned. Despite <loc>Ireland</loc>'s strong economic performance throughout 2018, the weakness of sterling and Brexit-related uncertainty affected new car registrations over the past 12 months, Jim Power, an economist with the Society of the Irish Motor Industry (SIMI), said. New registrations for January were down compared with the same month last year, according to the official figures, Mr Power said. Registrations of 191 cars were 32,374 in January, a fall of 12.6 per cent on the 37,023 recorded in January last year. SIMI said that sales had dropped consistently since the start of 2018 and that in the event of a no-deal Brexit they could be expected to fall further. "Based on what we know at the moment, the new car market could decline from around 125,422 to around 110,000, a decline of 12.3 per cent," Mr Power said. "In the event of a no-deal Brexit sales would be weaker, and in the event of a deal and the removal of uncertainty, sales could match 2018." The same trend applied to the light commercial and heavy goods vehicle categories, which declined by 1,103 to 5,650 and by 46 to 356 respectively year-on-year. Used car imports remained relatively static, with 9,006 registrations processed in January this year compared with 9,061 in January 2018. <loc>UK</loc> imports are proving popular with some Irish buyers due to a fall in sterling. Sales of electric vehicles were up. A total of 811 were sold compared with 104 in January of last year. The five top-selling car brands for the month were Hyundai, Volkswagen, Ford, Toyota, and Nissan, with Hyundai Tucson the bestselling vehicle. Brian Cooke, director-general designate of SIMI, said the new vehicle registrations for the month were "disappointing but not surprising". "The weakness of sterling is continuing to drive down used car values, which is increasing the cost to change," Mr Cooke said. CREDIT: Cianan Brennan <loc>Ireland</loc> Business Reporter
