 Last week, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow confirmed reports that former presidential candidate and onetime CEO of Godfather's Pizza, Herman Cain, is being considered for a vacant Federal Reserve governor seat.
Aside from sexual-harassment allegations , which first surfaced during his presidential campaign and which he denied, Mr. Cain's lack of credentials in economics may rankle a couple of past candidates who didn't pass congressional muster. Take Nobel laureate Peter Diamond.
"Does Dr. Diamond have any experience in conducting monetary policy? No," said Senator Richard Shelby in 2011, explaining his objections to the labor economist's candidacy for vice chairman.
Or fellow-reject Alicia Munnell, a long-time Fed economist who allegedly wouldn't have been tough enough on inflation.
But Mr. Cain, still-remembered for his "9-9-9" tax plan , is no hawk himself, telling Fox News that he would "encourage the Fed not to make inflation a fear factor ."
Mr. Diamond and Ms. Munnell may want to give Congress a pizza their mind.
