 <loc>Japan</loc> and <loc>Germany</loc> avoided slipping into recession as 2018 drew to a close, but the world's third- and fourth-largest economies seem set for a year of weak expansion amid uncertainty about the future of global trade rules and the severity of <loc>China</loc>'s slowdown.
An abrupt slowdown in the eurozone's industrial powerhouse in the second half of last year partly reflected short-term problems in its key automobile and chemical industries. Similarly, <loc>Japan</loc>'s economy was hit in the third quarter by a typhoon that closed a major airport and an earthquake that left the northern island of <loc>Hokkaido</loc> without electricity for two days.
<loc>Japan</loc>'s return to growth was more decisive than <loc>Germany</loc>'s in the final three months of the year, with gross domestic product increasing at an annualized rate of 1.4% in the Asian giant, compared with 0.1% in its European counterpart.
But both suffered from weakening exports, which will likely continue to hold back growth this year. Exports subtracted 0.3 percentage point from Japanese growth in the October-December quarter, showing the impact of the <loc>U.S.</loc>-<loc>China</loc> trade conflict and the overall slowdown in the Chinese economy.
"Risk is tilted toward the downside, in our view, with further economic slowdown in <loc>China</loc> and around the globe and a deterioration in sentiment due to trade friction as the main downside risk factors," said Goldman Sachs economist Naohiko Baba.
In addition to the prospect of weaker sales to Chinese buyers, <loc>Germany</loc> also faces the threat of a rise in <loc>U.S.</loc> tariffs on automobile imports from <loc>Europe</loc>, and the impact of a potentially disorderly <loc>U.K.</loc> departure from the European Union .
"The headwinds to German exporters should pick up further," said Andreas Rees, an economist at UniCredit.
Responding to the fourth-quarter figures, Deutsche Bank slashed its growth forecast for this year to 0.5% from 1%. If realized, that would be the weakest expansion rate since 2013, when the eurozone was still mired in its government-debt and banking crises.
<loc>Germany</loc>'s slowdown is part of a wider European trend that has cast a cloud over the global economy's prospects this year. <loc>Italy</loc> entered a technical recession at the end of last year—defined as two straight quarters of falling output—with <loc>France</loc>'s economy impaired by mass protests against President Emmanuel Macron's reform agenda.
 Figures also released Thursday by the <loc>EU's</loc> statistics agency showed the eurozone economy grew at an annualized rate of 0.8% in the final three months of last year, a slightly weaker expansion than the 0.9% it previously estimated. And there were signs that weakness was spreading to other European countries that have close ties with <loc>Germany</loc>, with <loc>Poland</loc>'s economy slowing sharply in the final quarter.
Figures released Wednesday showed factory output in the eurozone fell at the fastest annual pace in nine years as 2018 drew to a close, with the sector seeing two straight quarters of contraction as overseas demand for equipment and tools weakens.
As a leading exporter, <loc>Germany</loc>'s fortunes often reflect swings in the global economy, and the signs aren't encouraging. German goods exports to <loc>China</loc> dropped 7.6% from a year earlier in December, while shipments to the <loc>U.S.</loc> and the <loc>U.K.</loc> fell by 6.4% and 8.8%, respectively, from December 2017, according to the country's statistics body.
Figures released Thursday that show <loc>China</loc>'s exports surged in January appear to be a rare piece of good news for the global economy. But economists cautioned that they likely reflect exporters hurrying out orders ahead of February's Lunar New Year holiday and ahead of a March 1 deadline to reach a trade deal. Even given what will likely prove to be a temporary boost to activity, <loc>China</loc>'s imports from the rest of the world fell for the second straight month.
