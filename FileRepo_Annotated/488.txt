  <loc>China</loc>'s exports increased ­unexpectedly in January on the back of a surge in goods to the <loc>European Union</loc> and <loc>Southeast <loc>Asia</loc></loc>, along with orders placed ahead of Lunar New Year.
Data from <loc>China</loc>'s General Administration of Customs ­released yesterday showed that January's exports rose 9.1 per cent from a year earlier, beating a ­median forecast of economists by Bloomberg, which had predicted a 3.3 per cent decline.
It is a significant improvement on December, when exports fell by 4.4 per cent, and will offer some comfort to policymakers in <loc>­Beijing</loc>, as the <loc>US</loc>-<loc>China</loc> trade war continues to fester.
Manufacturers have accelerated the relocation of theirproduction bases out of <loc>China</loc>, which pushed up <loc>China</loc>'s exports to destinations in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), said ANZ senior economist Betty Wang.
 Exports to the <loc>European Union</loc> jumped 14.5 per cent in January from a year earlier, while exports to Asean improved by 11.5 per cent.
 The surge in exports to the <loc>European Union</loc> and Asean offset weakness in <loc>China</loc>'s exports to the <loc>US</loc>, which fell 2.8 per cent year on year in January after a 3.5 per cent drop in December.
M.K. Tang, senior <loc>China</loc> ­economist at Goldman Sachs, however, warned that the trade data was probably distorted ­because of seasonal factors, given that Lunar New Year falls on ­different ­calendar dates each year.
This year's week-long public holiday began on February 4 compared to February 15 in 2018.
Strong January data should therefore not be a sign of strong underlying export growth ­because exporters typically front-load their shipments ahead of the holiday, Tang said.
Imports dropped 1.5 per cent from a year earlier, beating the analysts' prediction of a 10.2 per cent decline.
Imports had plunged 7.6 per cent in December, while ­January's figure shows the ­deterioration in domestic ­demand ahead of Lunar New Year. Business activity typically slows down one to two weeks ­before the holidays, as workers ­return to their ­hometowns.
<loc>China</loc>'s overall trade surplus narrowed to US$39.16 billion in January from US$57.06 billion in December after economists had predicted a surplus of US$34.30 billion.
Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior <loc>China</loc> economist at Capital ­Economics, said that adjusting the trade data for seasonal ­volatility in January, <loc>China</loc>'s ­exports and imports both picked up but remained weaker than a few months ago.
"Even if the latest recovery in trade is genuine, the outlook for this year is still downbeat," ­Evans-Pritchard said.
"Cooling domestic demand and easing commodity price ­inflation will remain a headwind to imports in the near-term."
Nick Marro, analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, said that contractionary pressures in exports in <loc>South <loc>Korea</loc></loc> and <loc>­Taiwan</loc> reflected headwinds in the global consumer electronics ­industry and to regional ­economic growth.
That pointed to downward pressure in Chinese shipments regardless of "what happens with the trade ­negotiations this week," Marro said.
President Xi Jinping and ­Vice-Premier Liu He are expected to meet a top <loc>US</loc> delegation that includes <loc>US</loc> trade representative Robert Lighthizer and <loc>US</loc> ­Treasury Secretary Steven ­Mnuchin, in <loc>Beijing</loc> today in hopes of reaching an agreement to end the trade war.
