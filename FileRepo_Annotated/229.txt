 This morning, the pound euro exchange rate is pushing back after slipping yesterday afternoon, and is currently trading at a rate of [Euro]1.139. Data released this morning showed that the Eurozone’s largest economy suffered a further fall in manufacturing orders, sparking fears of a recession.

German factory orders plunged a further -1.6 percent, despite a forecast predicting that orders would actually grow in December; the data showed that this was likely due to orders from outside the bloc falling by -5.5 percent while domestic orders slipped by -0.6 per cent. This fuelled further fears that the German economy is heading towards a recession, with a Deutsche Bank economist stating: “The start of the German economy into 2019 has been a major disappointment so far. The development of several key cyclical indicators is telling us that the German economy is drifting towards a recession right now.”

Further cause for concern came as <loc>Germany</loc>’s construction PMI for January revealed activity growth had softened, slipping to 50.7 from 53.3.
Phil Smith, Principal Economist at IHS Markit, blamed the weak German data on bad weather: “The fact that growth in total industry activity slowed down more than new orders, which remained comparatively robust, suggests that it wasn’t necessarily a demand-driven slowdown and that severe bad weather probably did cause some disruption to actual work on the ground during the opening month of the year.”
