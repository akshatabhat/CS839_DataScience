 Niti Aayog member Dr Ramesh Chand , an agricultural economist, visited <loc>Punjab</loc> from January 29 to February 1 as part of the 15th Finance Commission. He spoke to TOI's Sanjeev Verma As the Centre announced Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi of Rs 6,000 per annum for marginal and small farmers, should the fertiliser and other farm subsidies be ended? Under this programme, Rs 6,000 per annum is a structured income support for the small landholders who are generally poor and vulnerable. It is not a direct benefit transfer (DBT) in lieu of support for the farm sector through subsidies. To address the problem of crop glut, is there a need for price stabilisation fund on the lines of national calamity relief fund? Similarly, can <loc>India</loc> regulate production of various crops based on domestic and export demand as is being done by developed countries like <loc>USA</loc>, <loc>UK</loc> and <loc>Australia</loc>? The price stabilisation fund already exists for some cash crops. However, fluctuation in prices turns out to be much higher than what can be addressed through available stabilisation fund. Regulating production does not work in a democratic set up. However, acreage under different crops can be influenced through advisory to farmers about future prices and incentives for allocating less or more area under different crops.
Is there is an urgent need to implement agriculture marketing reforms?
Market reforms have been emphasised by various experts and committees since mid-1990s. This is the only solution to many price-related problems faced by farmers. Niti Aayog and Union agriculture ministry have strongly pushed for market reforms during the last three years. However, reforms have to be done by states as agriculture, included marketing, is a state subject.
How does Niti Aayog plan to address the crises in farm sector?
Farm sector has shown more than 4% growth in output during recent three years, including advance estimates for the year 2018-19. There is a problem of low food and agriculture inflation which is keeping farm prices depressed.
Niti Aayog keeps suggesting various measures for this and other issues related to farm sector from time to time.
Why have state governments failed to intervene in marketing of agricultural and horticultural produce?
There is some positive intervention but there is need to do much more. In fact, if states do not interfere in marketing of horticultural crops through Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act the situation can turn out to be much better.
How can states like <loc>Punjab</loc> deal with the problem of sugarcane farmers? Every time cane farmers feel that the fair and remunerative price announced by the Centre is less and then the states have to intervene with state assured price.
Currently, <loc>India</loc> is facing problem of surplus sugar production over demand and export option is not working because international prices are lower than domestic prices. The sugarcane pricing formula suggested by Dr Rangarajan Committee based on open market prices of sugar balances the interest of miller, states, consumers and producers.
You have interacted with the <loc>Punjab</loc> government officials as a member of the 15th Finance Commission. How do you see <loc>Punjab</loc>'s financial condition vis√†-vis its populist poll promises?
Fiscal situation of the state is under stress as most of its revenue goes for payment of interest, salary and pension. Fiscal prudence is the need of the hour for the state.
You belong to <loc>Punjab</loc> and are an agricultural economist, what options are there for <loc>Punjab</loc> farmers to end paddy and wheat rotation?
Most of the problem attributed to paddy and wheat rotation follows from policies. Also, many natural resources and environmental problems are related to paddy and not wheat. In my opinion, <loc>Punjab</loc> needs to reduce area under paddy, as wheat is quite suitable for cultivation in <loc>Punjab</loc> on all accounts. Both these crops give very high yield and income in the state. I have been suggesting area-specific enterprises to replace some area under paddy. The alternative could be agroforestry in Kandi area, different vegetables in different pockets of the state, some horticulture and more area under fodder through expansion of dairy.
After the Green Revolution, how did <loc>Punjab</loc> lose track on growth trajectory?
<loc>Punjab</loc> lost track in non-agriculture sector. The state suffered due to low growth in industry and services sector. Prosperity brought by agriculture to the state during 1970s, 1980s and 1990s created huge demand for inputs and industrial products in the state. However, supply of these came from outside the state. Therefore, industry outside <loc>Punjab</loc> benefited from the backward and forward linkage created by growth of agriculture in the state. If <loc>Punjab</loc> internalises some of these linkages through industrialisation in the state, it will move to higher growth path.
One of the options for <loc>Punjab</loc> is motivating farmers to produce maize but the state does not procure maize as it is not distributed in the public distribution system. Also, <loc>Punjab</loc> has not been able to attract industries to produce ethanol from maize.
Sadly, maize is getting popular in rabi season and replacing wheat. This is not a very desirable change. The state needs to find alternative in kharif season for paddy. The state can make use of central assistance under PMASHA to procure maize.
