 THE EU's hardline stance on Brexit was challenged last night as German economists warned that <loc>Brussels</loc> might not have the upper hand. They said the Irish backstop should be torn up and called for more flexibility to preserve friendly ties with the <loc>UK</loc>. A report by the influential Ifo Institute and universities across <loc>Europe</loc> said <loc>Brussels</loc> must 'abandon its indivisibility dogma' on the EU's four freedoms - the free movement of goods, capital, services and labour. It warned that <loc>Brussels</loc> may be deluding itself in thinking that the EU has the upper hand or that the <loc>UK</loc> will capitulate before March 29. 'In a standard game of chicken, the actor who loses the most will dodge first. Can the EU really be sure that losses are sufficiently asymmetrically distributed that it "wins" this game?' the report asked. 'We call on the <loc>UK</loc> Government and the EU Commission to rethink their "red lines" and return to the negotiation table.' The report rebuked the European Commission for mishandling negotiations, stating: 'Since 2000, the <loc>UK</loc> paid a net contribution to the EU budget of 76bn euros. One may argue that this fact alone merits a fair treatment of the second-largest European economy.' It proposes that the EU and <loc>Britain</loc> form a joint trade body to cover goods. Meanwhile, ministers became embroiled in a Twitter row with Donald Tusk yesterday after he claimed Theresa May had not been clear about what she wanted from Brexit talks. Tory deputy chairman James Cleverly called the European Council President's comments 'ridiculous', and Liz Truss, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: 'On Tuesday Parliament was clear. We want the Prime Minister's deal plus changes to the backstop. Over to you.' The pair responded after Mr Tusk tweeted his public appeal to the Prime Minister about her aims, adding: 'The Withdrawal Agreement is not open for renegotiation.'
