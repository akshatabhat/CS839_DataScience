 The government on Thursday sharply revised the GDP growth estimates for the last two financial years, resulting in a 7.2% expansion in 2017-18 and an 8.2% acceleration in economic activity in 2016-17 -- making the year of demonetisation the fastest growing fiscal since 2010-11.
The numbers for 2016-17 surprised economists as there was widespread belief that demonetisation slowed down the economy significantly. With quarterly estimates for the year unavailable, analysts were unable to get a fix on the numbers.
"The GDP data for FY17 doesn't fit in well with high frequency data and the narrative of slowdown after demonetisation. Once quarterly data is released there will be more clarity on how growth evolved during that year," said A Prasanna, chief economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership.
Another economist suggested that CSO may have over-estimated the extent of economic activity in the informal sector, which is seen to have borne the brunt of the Modi government's decision to scrap the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.
Government officials said the impact of demonetisation was not felt so significantly up to December, when the old currency could still be used for several transactions.
