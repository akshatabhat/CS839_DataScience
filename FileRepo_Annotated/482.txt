5:50PMMarkets wrap: Four-day rally derailed by shock drop in <loc>US</loc> retail sales
The four-day rally on European markets was derailed by a shock drop in <loc>US</loc> retail sales growth stoking concerns that the global slowdown has spread to the resilient American economy.
Monthly retail sales growth excluding fuel slumped to a post-financial crisis low, contracting 1.8pc in December. The decline is "hard to square" with strong <loc>US</loc> job figures but the drop suggests that its economy "entered 2019 with less momentum than anticipated", said Michael Pearce of Capital Economics.
The FTSE 100 avoided the worst of the stocks slide to post a fourth straight day of gains as sterling tumbled on fears the Government would lose a key Brexit vote in the House of Commons.
The pound hit a one-month low versus the dollar and euro amid speculation of a rebellion within the Conservative Party, slipping as low as $1.2773 and [Euro]1.1313, respectively. The FTSE 100 gave up most of its strong early gains, closing just 0.1pc higher at 7,197.01. German stocks led the drop in <loc>Europe</loc> while Wall Street opened lower on the growth jitters.

3:58PMShock December slump in <loc>US</loc> retail sales sets alarm bells ringing
<loc>US</loc> retail sales were “off-the-charts bad” in December, falling at the fastest rate since 2009, and suggesting the world's largest economy lost momentum at the end of the year.
Consumers spent 1.2pc less on retail compared with November over the Christmas trading period - a fall far worse than expectations and one that suggests GDP growth in the fourth quarter may be lower than thought.
Control group retail sales, a measure that excludes cars, petrol, construction materials and food services, slumped 1.7pc, something not seen since just after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. This measure is preferred by many economists as it excludes items that have more volatile prices.

David Costley-Wood, partner at KPMG and joint administrator, said:
“To have been able to secure the future of the majority of the Patisserie Valerie and Philpotts business, along with such a significant number of jobs, all against a challenging backdrop, is really pleasing."

<loc>Europe</loc>'s Airbus announced plans to scrap production of the A380 superjumbo on Thursday, abandoning its dream of dominating the skies with a cruiseliner for the 21st century after years of lacklustre sales.
The world's largest airliner, with two decks of spacious cabins and room for 544 people in standard layout, was designed to challenge Boeing's legendary 747 but failed to take hold as airlines backed a new generation of smaller, more nimble jets.
Airbus said in a statement that the last A380 would be delivered in 2021.

9:27AM<loc>Germany</loc> could still have suffered a recession
It is still "touch-and-go whether <loc>Germany</loc> was in a technical recession in the second half of last year", according to Andrew Kenningham at Capital Economics.
A more detailed estimate due next week could show that <loc><loc>Germany</loc></loc> did in fact contract <loc>in</loc> the final few months of the year.
  The lack of "temporary factors" to blame for <loc>Germany</loc>'s fourth quarter stagnation "bodes ill for economic growth this year too", Mr Kenningham added. <loc>Germany</loc>'s third quarter had been heavily impacted by <loc>disruption</loc> to its car manufacturing sector after changes to <loc>EU</loc> emissions standards.

9:01AMGerman growth downgrade could signal slower eurozone in Q4

- Richard Partington (@RJPartington) February 14, 2019
The downgrade to <loc>Germany</loc>'s fourth quarter growth could signal that the overall eurozone slowed sharper than feared at the end of 2018.
A second estimate of eurozone growth for the final three months of the year is expected to show growth at 0.2pc this morning but economists underestimated the weakness in <loc>Germany</loc>. Figures for the wider currency bloc will drop at 10am.
"While this indicates that some of the transitory headwinds affecting German industry are finally fading, it seems the rebound in industrial activity may be spread out over several months," said Daniel Harenberg of <loc>Oxford</loc> Economics.
He added that "the strength in domestic demand, particularly in investment, is encouraging" for future growth.

8:36AMAgenda: <loc>Germany</loc> narrowly avoids slipping into recession as markets edge higher on tariff delay hopes
<loc>Germany</loc> narrowly avoided slipping into recession at the end of 2018 but growth flatlined in the fourth quarter as its manufacturing sector grapples with a global industrial slump.
After contracting 0.2pc in the third quarter of 2018, higher government spending and rising investment helped <loc>Germany</loc>'s economy avoid a technical recession - two quarters of negative growth.
However, early indicators in 2019 have suggested that <loc>Europe</loc>'s engine room has struggled to bounce back from last year's soft second half. Survey data indicates that its embattled manufacturing sector saw growth slow further in January.
Hopes of cooling trade tensions helped European markets shrug off the worse-than-feared figures from <loc>Germany</loc>. Donald Trump is reportedly mulling a 60-day extension to a tariff deadline that would impact $200bn of Chinese goods in early March.
The FTSE 100 edged up 0.2pc in early trade, entering a fourth day of gains.
