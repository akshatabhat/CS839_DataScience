 From reduced cash in the Indian economy to the uncertainties in the West, a host of issues have seen overseas investments by Indians--Reserve Bank of <loc>India</loc> (RBI) calls its outward FDI (ODI)--dip by $1 billion in 2018, even as investments in some major sectors went up.
According to data from the RBI, maintained for calendar years, ODI for 2018 stood at $11 billion, compared to $12 billion in 2017. For the same period, the "number of Indian parties investing overseas" stood at 3,641 and 3,759, respectively.
The data includes outflow in equity, loan and guarantees invoked, and, in 2016, 3,510 Indian parties had invested $13.2 billion, which means that the dip in 2017 was more than $1 billion. Company-wise details of investments are not maintained. Economist Prof Charan Singh, CEO, e-GROW, who has also served at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), says: "The reasons for the dip that come to mind immediately is that the overall income level in our economy and country has dipped in the last few years, also, there are now more opportunities to invest within <loc>India</loc>."
Experts also pointed to a host of global factors, including volatile currencies and political uncertainties as reasons for retarded investments. Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, CARE Ratings, says: "Most of the ventures overseas have had mixed results. Global economy hasn't picked up, <loc>US</loc> seems slightly better, but not confident of growth being sustained. So, it looks like western economies aren't providing the same kind of options as domestic, although our economy has its own problems."
