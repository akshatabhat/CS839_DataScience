 <loc>UK</loc> economic growth is expected to have slowed in the final quarter of last year but economists warned against viewing the data as a sign the <loc>UK</loc> is headed for recession.
Economists believe that gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed to 0.3% in the three months to December.
It comes after growth cooled off in the three months to November, rising 0.3% compared to the previous quarter. Growth of 0.4% was recorded in the three months to October.
The third quarter of 2018 saw GDP rise by 0.6%, reflecting strong retail sales during the World Cup and a recovery in construction activity.
Month-on-month growth for December is forecast to be flat.
Growth was likely impacted by some short-term factors, such as the seasonal effect of Black Friday on retailers.
Samuel Tombs, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: "All told, December's GDP report will look poor, but with most of the weakness reflecting temporary disruption in the retail and industrial sectors, it should not be taken as a signal that the economy is sliding into recession."
The industrial sector is expected to weigh on <loc>Britain</loc>'s economic growth, despite production hitting a seven-month high in December.
The official PMI calculation includes buying volumes, which rose as companies stockpiled parts ahead of a possible no-deal Brexit.
With this stripped out, the output index fell in December, pointing to a broader trend of flatlining growth in the sector.
