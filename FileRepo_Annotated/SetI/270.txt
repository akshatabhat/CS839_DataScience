Debt is rising more quickly in the <loc>United States</loc> than most people would prefer. This is happening in part because the <loc>U.S.</loc> current account deficit and the country’s high level of income inequality distort the structure and amount of American savings.
Many Americans are worried about the seemingly inexorable rise in <loc>U.S.</loc> debt, whether government debt, household debt, or business debt. They are right to be concerned. Rapidly rising debt is a problem not just in the <loc>United States</loc> but in many other countries too, including <loc>China</loc>, parts of <loc>Europe</loc>, and most of the developing world. In today’s environment, it seems, reasonable levels of economic growth cannot be achieved unless boosted by even faster growth in debt.
With so much debt in the world, and with debt levels rising so quickly, people tend to think that economists have studied this issue deeply and fully understand it. But there continues to be a great deal of confusion about debt and about whether and why excessive debt levels can harm growth prospects. To try to address these issues, this blog post is divided into two parts. The first part discusses debt and some of the conditions under which it affects the prospects for economic growth.
The second part argues that at least two of the reasons that debt has been rising inexorably in the <loc>United States</loc> for several years are the country’s rising income inequality and its persistent trade deficit. Surprising as it may seem at first glance, these two conditions operate the same way: they distort the level and structure of American savings. As long as income inequality remains high and the <loc>United States</loc> runs large deficits, the resulting savings distortions will continue to mean that <loc>U.S.</loc> debt levels have to rise to prevent the economy from slowing and unemployment from rising.
