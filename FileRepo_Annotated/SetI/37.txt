 More people in <loc>Singapore</loc>, including foreigners, were working last year as the labour market improved, but observers say the year ahead may be challenging.
The latest full-year estimates released by the Manpower Ministry (MOM) yesterday show that unemployment fell in 2018 and retrenchments dropped to a six-year low.
This is despite economic growth easing slightly from 2017. Advance estimates put growth at 3.3 per cent last year, down from 3.6 per cent in 2017.
MOM data shows that the typical Singaporean in full-time work earned more last year, with median income - including employer contributions to the Central Provident Fund - rising 3.3 per cent year on year to $4,183 as of June. But the pace of growth slowed from the 5.9 per cent seen in 2017.
DBS economist Irvin Seah said the slower income growth is consistent with the slower pace of economic expansion, and both are expected to be lower this year. MOM noted in its report that year-on-year income changes are prone to fluctuations because data is captured from a sample survey.
Real median income actually grew over the last five years, at an average of 3.6 per cent per year, higher than the 1.7 per cent per year in the previous five years. Over the same period, real income of Singaporeans at the 20th percentile - those earning lower wages - grew at an even faster pace, at an average of 4.3 per cent per year.
In terms of employment, the workforce grew by 39,300 last year, excluding foreign domestic workers. Of these additional workers, 28,400 were Singaporeans or permanent residents, while 10,900 were foreigners.
