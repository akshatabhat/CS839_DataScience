The monthly survey of consume­r confidence compiled by <loc>Westpac</loc> and the <loc>Melbourne</loc> Instit­ute shows a large majority of people say their personal financial position has worsened this past year. The pressure on living stand­ards has been accentuated by the relatively large rises in the cost of essential services. Electricity ­prices have risen 20 per cent in the past three years while medical services are up 16 per cent, insurance is up 15 per cent and education is up 10 per cent. Households have to adjust by spending relatively less on discretionary items.
These trends are evident across the advanced world. Central bankers used to rely on equations purporting to show that when unemployment fell below a certain level, a predictable wage rise would result, but the maths have failed since the financial crisis. Wages are stagnant everywhere.
Although consumer prices are not rising like they used to either, the widespread feeling among people that they are not making headway is feeding a resentment that populist parties have been able to capitalise upon, promising to tackle the class of insiders it is assumed has been profiting at everyone else’s expense.
In <loc>Britain</loc>, Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn warns that the “rich are living on borrowed time”, while in the <loc>US</loc>, Donald Trump vowed to “drain the swamp”. In <loc>Australia</loc>, Bill Shorten’s villain is the “top end of town”.
So far in <loc>Australia</loc>, declining living standards have not led to a general consumer funk. Throughout last year, a majority of consume­rs expressed confidence about the outlook for both the economy and their personal finance­s, even if the latter had been struggling for some time.
But the latest trends raise concern. Consumers cut spending at Christmas, car sales are down sharply and economists with the big banks say their internal tracking of card transactions shows continuing weakness. A narrow majority of consumers is now pessimistic about the outlook.
Market economists noted a fall in the volume of retail sales in NSW in the final three months of last year, warning this may reflect falling house prices. Sales remain strong in <loc>Victoria</loc>, where house prices are also falling, but <loc>Sydney</loc> has been ahead of <loc>Melbourne</loc> throughout the housing cycle.
The Reserve Bank believes employm­ent will remain strong, wages will lift and households will keep spending, but acknowledges that a consumer retreat is the biggest domestic risk to the outlook.
It is fertile ground for Labor. Many will agree with its pitch that low wages growth is leaving them falling further behind, although its promise to restore penalty rates would make little discernible difference to the national outcome.
Personal income tax cuts are the only answer either side has to falling real incomes and they will be at the centre of the election campaigns for both parties.If consumer spending continues to ­soften, the economic argument for personal tax cuts will match the political case.
