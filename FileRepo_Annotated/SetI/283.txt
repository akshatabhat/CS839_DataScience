Born in <loc>Hamburg</loc>, then-West <loc>Germany</loc>, in July 1954, Angela Merkel began her political career as the <loc>Berlin</loc> Wall came down in 1989. She briefly served as a deputy spokesperson for the first democratically elected <loc>East <loc>Germany</loc></loc> headed by Lothar de Maizière. In a 2017 episode of BBC Newsnight, economist Anne McElvoy, who has been following Mrs Merkel's career for decades, claimed that she remembers the now German Chancellor as a “mousy figure”, who “blushed readily” and was “mocked as the milkmaid” in 1989.

Editor-in Chief of BILD Taint Koch added that Mrs Merkel was seen as "that girl from <loc>East <loc>Germany</loc></loc> with no political experience who had a funny haircut and to whom Westerners had to teach how political life in <loc>Germany</loc> is run”.
However, Ms Koch noted how she “learned a lot from experience and being underestimated has always helped her”.
Following German reunification in 1990, Mrs Merkel was elected to the Bundestag for the state of <loc>Mecklenburg</loc>-<loc>Vorpommern</loc> and has been reelected ever since.
As the protégée of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Mrs Merkel was appointed as the Federal Minister for Women and Youth in Mr Kohl's government in 1991, and became the Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety in 1994.
East German Defence Minister Rainer Eppelmann recalled how “sneering” remarks in the press were about her soon after her appointment.

He said: “[The reports were] like ‘How will Kohl’s girl cope with a ministerial post?'
“‘Her predecessor was so good, she will only disgrace herself'.
“But she was outstanding.”
Ms McElvoy claimed that her “slow and steady outmanoeuvring of rivals in those early years still defines her”.
She added: “After Gerhard Schröder, the bullish SPD Chancellor patronised Merkel, she vowed to put him in a corner, and eventually she did.”
Mrs Merkel took Mr Schroder’s post in 2005 and became the first female chancellor at the head of a grand coalition constituting of the CDU, the Christian Social Union and the Social Democratic Party.
