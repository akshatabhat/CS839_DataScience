    The decline of <loc>EU</loc> values in individual member states has, sadly, demonstrated the failure of the European Commission to fulfill its most important task - to serve as 'Guardian of the Treaties.'
   Partly because of ambitious compromises in the name of developing the European project and partly because of the personal realpolitik of politicians from the European People's Party (EPP) and Party of European Socialists (PES), the <loc>EU</loc> seems incapable of surviving the current storm, unless there is a change of leadership.
Sinking ship
   While the democratic decay in <loc>Hungary</loc> and <loc>Poland</loc> has attracted much commentary, a quick glimpse at reputable indices not only shows that <loc>EU</loc> values are challenged in many member states, but also demonstrates the huge - if not widening - gap between <loc>EU</loc> countries, which a long line of Commissions has struggled to address.
   The 2018 Democracy Index by the Economist Intelligence Unit categorized 17 <loc>EU</loc> member states as flawed democracies, along with candidate states like <loc>Serbia</loc>.
   In the latest 2018 Corruption Perceptions Index by Transparency International, Denmark received 88 points and was ranked as the least corrupt <loc>EU</loc> member while <loc>Bulgaria</loc> received only 42 points and confirmed its title as the most corrupt <loc>EU</loc> member.
The difference in scores between the two countries is more than double. Moreover, <loc>Bulgaria</loc> has been receiving almost the same poor marks since the time of Barroso's Commission.
Worrisome trends have also been confirmed by the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators. If one compares the scores in the Rule of Law indicator in 2007 and 2017, one notes that the rankings of <loc>Cyprus</loc>, <loc>Greece</loc>, <loc>Hungary</loc>, <loc>Italy</loc>, and <loc>Malta</loc> have palpably worsened. <loc>Austria</loc>, <loc>Germany</loc> and <loc>Spain</loc> have also recorded noticeable declines in their rule of law ranking.
In turn, there is a stark contrast between members like <loc>Finland</loc>, which were placed in the highest percentile in both the 2007 and the 2017 measurement (99th and 100th), and members like <loc>Bulgaria</loc>, which were placed slightly above the median percentile (53rd and 52nd) in both measurements.
