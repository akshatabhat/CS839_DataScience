 THE RAND'S bull run this year reached a five months high yesterday as the <loc>US</loc> Federal Reserve kept its interest rate unchanged, while <loc>South <loc>Africa</loc></loc>'s December trade surplus - which surprised on the upside - added fresh impetus to the local currency. The local currency strengthened to a day's high of R13.24 against the <loc>US</loc> dollar before settling at R13.30 by 5pm.
Andre Botha, a senior currency dealer at TreasuryONE, said the Fed has shown that it is the main player in the markets at the moment.
"This dovish behaviour caused a sell-off in the <loc>US</loc> dollar and emerging market (EM) currencies enjoyed the unexpected windfall," Botha said.
"While EMs are doing well at the moment, one should just pause for a second and ask the question with the Fed halting rate hikes, what are they thinking regarding global growth and should that be an issue going forward then EMs will come under pressure?"
While the markets had already priced-in the decision by the <loc>US</loc> central bank, the Fed's dovish monetary tone saw EM currencies rally.
Annabel Bishop, Investec chief economist, said the statement from the Federal Open Market Committee was seen as dovish, strengthening the rand. "The perceived dovish tone of the Fed strengthens our view of no interest rate hikes for <loc>South <loc>Africa</loc></loc> in the first half of 2019, and if the Fed pause persists, it will suppress the likelihood of any <loc>SA</loc> rate hike in the second half of 2019 too," Bishop said.
While the Fed took centre stage yesterday, investors have now turned their attention to the <loc>US</loc>/<loc>China</loc> trade talks that began on Wednesday.
The two-day talks were expected to be a tense affair.
On the local front, the rand found support in December's trade surplus data that beat market expectations.
The South African Revenue Services said the country recorded a trade surplus of R17.2 billion in December, compared to a R3.29bn surplus in November.
NKC African Economics economist Elize Kruger said despite a bumper trade surplus in December, the trade performance in 2018 as a whole remained a major disappointment.
"Notwithstanding the resilience of the global economy and a notable depreciation in the rand exchange rate, South African exporters were unable to benefit meaningfully from these developments, while imports continued to outperform despite a low economic growth environment," Kruger said.
NKC said it estimated that a wider current account deficit of 3.7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) for 2018 compared to a deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP in 2017.
