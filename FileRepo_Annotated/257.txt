    SENIOR economist William Adams insisted that the <loc>EU</loc> has sided with the Republic of <loc>Ireland</loc> on Brexit and is willing to sacrifice economic growth to ensure the Brexit backstop issue is not changed.
   During an interview with CNBC senior economist of PNC William Adam revealed that the <loc>EU</loc> had sided with <loc>Ireland</loc> over the other <loc>EU</loc> member states because they would be more greatly impacted from Brexit. Mr Adams emphasised that the <loc>EU</loc> and <loc>Ireland</loc>’s highest priority was maintaining peace between <loc>Northern <loc>Ireland</loc></loc> and the Republic of <loc>Ireland</loc>. He said: “For the <loc>EU,</loc> I think the economic interests and the political interests point in opposite directions, which is why the <loc>EU</loc> is taking such a hardline approach.

   “The <loc>EU</loc> has decided in this negotiation that they are going to stand with <loc>Ireland</loc> which has the most at stake in the Brexit renegotiation.
“<loc>Ireland</loc>’s number one priority has been maintaining the Good Friday Agreement and for that, they need to maintain free movement for the Irish dual citizens who live in <loc>Northern <loc>Ireland</loc></loc> across the border into the Republic of <loc>Ireland</loc>.
“Because of that, I think <loc>Ireland</loc> has definitely recognised that Brexit would be a big blow to their economy.
  “And recognised it would be a lesser blow to other economies across the EU.
   William Adams has said the <loc>EU</loc> have sided with <loc>Ireland</loc> over <loc>EU</loc> states on Brexit
“The peace in <loc>Northern <loc>Ireland</loc></loc> is a higher priority for them.”
Today The European Commission sharply cut its forecasts for economic growth in the euro zone this year and next because of an expected slowdown in the largest countries of the bloc caused by global trade tensions and growing public debt.
   In its quarterly economic forecasts, the <loc>EU</loc> executive also revised down its estimates for the inflation in the 19 country currency bloc next year, which now is expected to be lower than forecast by the European Central Bank, likely complicating the bank's plans for an interest rate hike this year.
The Commission said eurozone growth will slow to 1.3 percent this year from 1.9 percent in 2018 and is expected to rebound in 2020 to 1.6 percent.
The new estimates are less optimistic than the Commission's previous forecasts, released in November when <loc>Brussels</loc> expected the eurozone to grow 1.9 percent this year and 1.7 percent in 2020.
 Growth in the 27 nation <loc>European Union,</loc> without <loc>Britain</loc>, is expected to slow to 1.5 percent this year from 2.1 percent in 2018. Next year, the bloc is forecast to expand by 1.8 percent.
 All countries of the <loc>European Union</loc> are poised to continue growing, with the bloc expected to post its seventh consecutive year of expansion, but the larger member states will break significantly.
With tensions still relatively high between the <loc>UK</loc> and <loc>Brussels</loc>, further exacerbated by Donald Tusk’s comments, the likelihood of a satisfying deal in time for March 29 has decreased.
Theresa May today is in <loc>Brussels</loc> to speak with Michel Barnier and Jean-Claude Juncker on renegotiating the backstop and the overall Brexit withdrawal agreement.
