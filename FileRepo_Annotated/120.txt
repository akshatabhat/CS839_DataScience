 THE medium-term seasonal outlook produced by the South African Weather Service (SAWS) remains benign for <loc>KwaZulu-Natal</loc> farmers with decent rains expected, while past rains have filled up some dams so that the average in 2018 was higher than the average in 2017.
This was also reflected in the October rainfall data that showed that <loc>Richards Bay</loc> in <loc>KZN</loc> had the highest rainfall of all weather stations with 177mm, while the University of <loc>Zululand</loc> was not far behind with 159mm. The rain was, however, patchy so <loc>Paddock</loc>, for instance, only had 45mm in October 2018 compared with 270mm in October 2017 and a long-term average of 134mm for October.
In December, <loc>Babanango</loc> had the highest monthly rainfall in <loc>KZN</loc> with 177mm and <loc>Ixopo</loc> also had decent rain with 159mm. <loc>Richards Bay</loc> had 88mm and <loc>Paddock</loc> had better rain than in October with an 80mm rainfall, while <loc>Cedara</loc> had 125mm, but <loc>Estcourt</loc> only had 43mm.
First National Bank agricultural economist Paul Makube said that in his view the outlook for the season ahead was moderate to favourable for most agricultural commodities with early season rains beneficial for cultivated crops and pastures.
"This bodes well for crops such as potatoes, soya beans, maize and sugar, including pastures, that are critical for beef and dairy despite concerns of the developing El Niño weather pattern," he said. He cautioned that some dryness late in the rainfall season was likely to impact negatively on the sugar crop.
The rains in early January resulted in a surprise for most analysts as the Agricultural Business Chamber of <loc>South Africa</loc> (Agbiz) had a projection of 1.98 million hectares, while the latest National Crop Estimates Committee (CEC) report indicated that farmers have planted 2.27 million ha of maize this season, which is only 2.2 percent less than last season.
"I suspect that the late plantings might have been more than anticipated following early January rainfall. Although this is a welcome development, it is important to stress that these are initial estimates," Agbiz economist Wandile Sihlobo said.
Afasa president Dr Vuyo Mahlati said: "This means that area planted (1.257 million ha) in the 2018/19 season for white maize is 0.88 percent (11 100ha) less than the area that was planted (1.268 million ha) in 2017/18 season. Therefore, this implies that the expected yield might be less as compared to the previous season. Similarly, with the yellow maize, the reduction of 38 850ha in the current season (1.012 million ha) is less than last year (1.051 million ha).
He said there were three implications for black farmers and communities.
First, the estimates showed that the drought had a serious effect on farmers in general. This also hampered efforts for black commercial farmer development as there was limited capacity for resilience. This in turn impacted on income to families.
Second, food security was adversely affected at household and national levels. Third, it was important to note black farmers were negatively affected by the fragmented planting support by the government.
