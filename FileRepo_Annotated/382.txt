 STEPHEN Pollard's article ("How a post-Brexit Britain can start to boom right now", February 9) reminds me of what was, at the time, a rather cynical observation of economists, in that they spend half of their time forecasting the future and the other half explaining why it didn't happen.
In which case, following the recent string of predictions of doom and gloom, it might be interesting to hear of their explanations post-Brexit.
