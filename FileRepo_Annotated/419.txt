 PROSPECTS OF RATE CUTS BRIGHTEN
In twin reliefs for the economy, retail inflation eased to an 18-month low at the start of the new year and industrial output growth picked up slightly in December from a 17-month low in November.
Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), cooled to 2.05% in January, data released by the statistics department on Tuesday showed. The previous low for consumer inflation was 1.46% in June 2017.
The simultaneously released Index of Industrial Production (IIP) was up 2.4% in December. Industrial growth was 0.3% in November, revised down from 0.5% estimated initially. The decline in inflation validates the Reserve Bank of <loc>India</loc>'s decision last week to lower the benchmark repo rate by 25 basis points, the first rate cut in 17 months.
Retail inflation has stayed below the RBI's mediumterm target of 4% for the fifth straight month and has opened up the possibility of more rate cuts going ahead with industrial growth remaining tepid. "While there is a case for another rate cut in case inflation remains low, the call would also take into account upcoming elections where the savings perspective may be considered," said CARE Ratings chief economist Madan Sabnavis.
The six-member monetary policy committee chaired by RBI governor Shaktikanta Das had changed the stance to 'neutral' from 'calibrated tightening' in its review last week. The persistent cold weather is likely to play a key role in inflation.
"Extended winter remains supportive of decelerating food prices," said Yes Bank chief economist Shubhada Rao. "This raises the probability of rate cut(s) in April and beyond too." A decline in food prices helped ease overall consumer inflation.
