 <loc>MUMBAI</loc>â€”<loc>India</loc>'s central bank cut its key lending rate Thursday, surprising economists at a time when the autonomy and reliability of the central bank and other authorities that help manage growth and jobs data in <loc>Asia</loc>'s third-largest economy are being questioned.
The Reserve Bank of <loc>India</loc> lowered the rate for the first time in a year and a half and sparked expectations of further cuts by paring its inflation forecast at its regular monetary policy meeting. Economists had predicted the central bank would hold interest rates steady to demonstrate vigilance about inflationary pressures from increased government spending, which was proposed last week in an interim budget. National polls are scheduled to be completed in <loc>India</loc> by mid-May, and historically <loc>New <loc>Delhi</loc></loc> has often blown out its budget in election years.
Some economists worry the decision to start a new easing cycle earlier than expected could signal an era in which the RBI, based in <loc>Mumbai</loc>, is more likely to bow to demands from politicians and government officials in <loc>New <loc>Delhi</loc></loc> who have called for more measures to boost growth.
"I think this does raise questions about the RBI's independence, particularly in going straight from a tightening stance to a rate cut," said Mark Williams, chief <loc>Asia</loc> economist at Capital Economics. "It's clear that the new governor has made all the difference."
It was the first monetary policy meeting for RBI Gov. Shaktikanta Das, a former government bureaucrat who took the helm of the central bank in December . His predecessor, Urjit Patel, resigned for what he said were personal reasons after trying to push back against political pressure.
Mr. Das pledged to uphold the independence of the central bank after being appointed in December. The rate easing comes ahead of elections in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party will seek to remain in power by convincing voters that the economy has thrived under its leadership.
Lower interest rates usually make it cheaper for consumers and industry to borrow, potentially boosting growth.
Finance Minister Piyush Goyal welcomed the rate cut, saying on Twitter that it "will give a boost to the economy, lead to affordable credit for small businesses, homebuyers etc. and further boost employment opportunities."
