 There were further signs yesterday of a manufacturing slowdown in the United States at the end of last year as a report showed that new orders for factory goods fell unexpectedly in November. They slid by 0.6 per cent compared with October, disappointing economists, who had forecast a 0.2 per cent rise, according to a report by the commerce department, which had been delayed by the US government shutdown. New orders in October fell by 2.1 per cent month-on-month. The factory orders report measures the dollar value of new orders for all types of goods made by American manufacturers. It is a gauge of the health of the manufacturing industry and an indicator of how well the US economy is performing more broadly. The effects of a trade war between America and China appear to have weighed on the manufacturing industries of both nations in the latter months of 2018. Leaders will continue to negotiate a trade deal this week after talks ended in Washington last week without an agreement. Wall Street dipped slightly in early trading yesterday, but the Dow Jones industrial average was roughly flat by lunchtime. The broader S&P 500 index was up by 0.3 per cent, or 7.51 points, at 2,714.04 at the same point. Yields on benchmark ten-year Treasury bonds were at 2.73 per cent, up from 2.69 per cent on Friday. Despite the manufacturing figures, economists generally are optimistic that the sector will kick back into gear. CREDIT: James Dean US Business Editor
