 Another bumper jobs report in America yesterday secured a record 100th consecutive month of rising employment and signalled that the economy is on a stronger footing than many had thought. Non-farm payrolls expanded by 304,000 jobs in January, the most in 11 months and significantly more than the 165,000 gain forecast by economists. The figure was published in the Department of Labor's monthly employment report, regarded as a gauge of the health of the US economy. However, the report is likely to be a headache for Jerome Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve, who indicated on Wednesday that it would hold off on plans to raise interest rates this year. When employment is at or near capacity, it is a sign that a central bank needs to raise rates to head off rising inflation. The report was not without its downsides. Wage growth climbed by only 0.1 per cent month-on-month in January, compared with the 0.3 per cent forecast by economists and the 0.4 per cent reported in December. Payroll gains in December were revised down markedly from 312,000 to 222,000. The unemployment rate edged up to 4 per cent in January from 3.9 per cent the month before, which was higher than expected, although the level is still very low. A sell-off on Wall Street in December had raised fears that the US economy was on the brink of a slowdown. Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said: "If employment growth remains this strong, there is still a fair chance of one more rate hike in the first half of this year." By midday in New York the S&P 500 was up by 0.1 per cent, or 3.82 points, to 2,708.23. The Dow Jones industrial average was 0.5 per cent higher, or 166.75 points, at 25,166.45 and the technologyfocused Nasdaq index was down by 0.1 per cent, or 9.40 points, at 7,272.32.
