 With elections looming, the political class seems to have its priorities sorted out: It's politics over economics and voter over the exchequer. The Centre and states have been doling out sops---from farm loan waivers and income support for agriculturalists to unemployment doles and even gold.
In BJP-ruled <loc>Assam</loc>, finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma raised the bar on Wednesday by offering gold, estimated to cost Rs 38,000, for brides from families with annual income of less than Rs 5 lakh. He also promised "e-bikes" for all girls who secure first division in higher secondary examination and a one-time subsidy of Rs 50,000 on all education loans sanctioned during the current financial year.
On Thursday, <loc>MP</loc> is expected to announce a monthly unemployment allowance of Rs 4,000, going one step ahead of <loc>Rajasthan</loc> which promised Rs 3,000-3,500. The Kamal Nath government in <loc>MP</loc> will also roll out a scheme guaranteeing 100 days of work for urban youth --a promise the CM made on Republic Day and reiterated in an interview to TOI a week ago. Sources said the Congress regime will also double social security pension for the elderly from Rs 300 to Rs 600. All three decisions were cleared by the CM and the finance department on Tuesday.
When it's poll season, taxes are something that no finance minister--either at the Centre or in states--wants to raise. Last Friday, the Centre offered 100% tax rebate for those earning up to Rs 5 lakh while offering concessions also to senior citizens and the middle class.
On Wednesday, Left-ruled <loc>Kerala</loc> deferred its plan to levy a "flood cess" on GST. It had argued for the cess on the ground that the money thus mopped up would be used for repairing the damage caused by the calamity.
There is no clarity whether the state would go ahead with its budget proposal until the Lok Sabha elections are over.
The pre-poll gifts come ahead of the general elections, which are expected to be keenly contested, prompting politicians to woo voters with freebies that economists have frowned upon on the ground that they could adversely impact the already-strained exchequer.
Questions are being raised on the impact that the annual farm income support of Rs 6,000 will have on the Centre's fiscal deficit that is projected to be higher next year. The Narendra Modi government's pension scheme for the unorganised sector, which is targeting 10 crore beneficiaries over 3-4 years, has an initial allocation of Rs 500 crore but will cost much more when it is rolled out.
Several states have already announced relief packages and waivers for farmers, with the promises on last count adding up to around Rs 2.3 lakh crore. The so-called farm distress has promoted politicians to rush to their rescue with states such as <loc>Telangana</loc>, <loc>Odisha</loc> and <loc>Jharkhand</loc> offering income support. The recent electoral success of TRS in <loc>Telangana</loc> has only strengthened the belief that income support for farmers can be vote-spinners. <loc>Telangana</loc>'s Rythu Bandhu and Odisha's Kalia schemes are expected to cost over Rs 22,000 crore annually.
Congress owes its success in <loc>Chhattisgarh</loc> and, to a lesser extent, in <loc>MP</loc> to its promise of farm loan waivers. Unemployment allowances are another popular currency, with the doles by the Ashok Gehlot government in <loc>Rajasthan</loc> expected to add Rs 525 crore. While several states, including <loc>Rajasthan</loc> , had introduced relief for the unemployed earlier, the latest announcements take the game to a new level. In states such as <loc>West Bengal</loc>, the payout was half the level at around Rs 1,500 a month, while in <loc>Haryana</loc> it ranged between Rs 900 and 1,500 and in <loc>Kerala</loc> it was Rs 1,440 a year.
