SIMONIS Storm expects government revenue to drop by 4,2%, 8,2% and 12,6% to N$54,3 billion, N$52,9 billion and N$53,6 billion in the financial years 2018/19, 2019/20 and 2020/21, respectively, on the back of sluggish VAT collection, lower Sacu revenues and declining income taxes on individuals and companies.
These projections are expected to emerge when the finance minister tables the budget in parliament during the second week of March.
