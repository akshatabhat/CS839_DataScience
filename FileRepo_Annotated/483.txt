 <loc>GERMANY</loc> narrowly escaped tumbling into recession at the end of last year after its economy stalled, temporarily relieving pressure on under-fire Chancellor Angel Merkel.
The latest figures from the Federal Statistics Office revealed Gross Domestic Product in <loc>Europe</loc>’s biggest economy - valued at £3.1trillion - remained unchanged in the final three months of 2018. This meant <loc>Germany</loc> barely escaped a recession that could potentially have plunged the entire eurozone into a state of severe panic. A recession is defined as two or more consecutive quarters of contraction, after the economy shrank 0.2 percent in the third quarter.

But pressure easing on Angela Merkel, financial experts have warned the German economy remains under severe threat, primarily through continued uncertainties around Brexit negotiations.
Andreas Scheuerle, an economist at <loc>Frankfurt</loc>-based Dekabank, said: "<loc>Germany</loc> got away with a black eye.
"But the first quarter is not looking like it is going to be easy, either, as political uncertainties are weighing heavily on corporate confidence."
Despite German growth stalling, some economists remain more optimistic about the country’s financial prospects.

ING economist Carsten Brzeski said: "The upside from today's data is that it can hardly get worse.
"Economic fundamentals remain solid, and from here on, chances of a rebound are still much higher than chances of yet another disappointment.”
<loc>Germany</loc>’s economy grew at its weakest rate in over five years in 2018. Growth is forecast to slump a further one percent in 2019 and is facing the prospect of a budget shortfall of £21.6billion by 2023.
 The <loc>European Union’s</loc> biggest economy has been battling slowing financial growth, largely resulting from trade disputes triggered by sanctions imposed <loc>US</loc> President Donald Trump on the likes of <loc>China</loc>, potentially costing companies billions of pounds.
   <loc>Germany</loc> also fears continued negotiations between <loc>Britain</loc> and the <loc>EU</loc> will result in a no-deal Brexit, potentially putting up to 100,000 jobs at risk and hitting its lucrative car making sector hardest, according to a study from the <loc>Halle</loc> Institute for Economic Research.
The fallout from both are weighing heavily on business confidence, which fell for the fifth successive month in January.

Morale is also falling as a result of weaker demand for German goods and services in <loc>China</loc>, the eurozone and emerging markets.
But despite the stalling economy provides much-needed short-term respite, Deutsche Bank - the country’s biggest lender - had warned <loc>Germany</loc> was dangerously close to sliding into recession, describing 2019 as a “major disappointment”.
The bank had predicted the economy would contract further in the final quarter of 2018 by the same 0.2 percent margin from the previous three month period.
Deutsche Bank economists wrote in a report last week: “The start of the German economy into 2019 has been a major disappointment so far.
“The development of several key cyclical indicators is telling us that the German economy is drifting towards recession right now.
"Given much weaker than expected January business surveys and in particular the slump in their more forward looking components we are now expecting the German economy to contract again in Q1 2019.

"Global economic policy uncertainty jumped in December marking a new all-time high.
"Most of the global trouble spots have taken a turn for the worse in January, making it very hard to assume a fundamental improvement during the reminder of Q1."
The German government has sent alarm bells ringing throughout the eurozone by reducing the GDP growth forecast for this year from 1.8 at the end of 2018 to just one percent.
Last week, German output surprisingly fell in December for the fourth consecutive month, with data from the Federal Statistics Office revealing industrial output slumped 0.4 percent from November and 3.9 percent from December 2017.
Thomas Gitzel of VP Bank Group, had warned: “A positive GDP reading in the fourth quarter of 2018 now looks tight.
“A positive industry reading would have reduced the chance of a negative GDP reading in the fourth quarter."
<loc>Germany</loc> news: Peter Altmaier said the contry could take stakes in key domestic companies
This latest gloomy reading came after <loc>Germany</loc>’s manufacturing sector plunged into contraction territory in January, dropping to 49.7 points from 51.1 in January, according to the latest figures from IHS Markit.
But <loc>Germany</loc>’s finance minister Olaf Scholz attempted to play down any turmoil, but warned slowing expansion would eventually lead to increased pressure on the country’s budget.
He told the Financial Times: “We can afford a lot, but not everything, and not at the same time.”
Last week, economy minister Peter Altmaier also hinted <loc>Germany</loc> could change tact by taking stakes in key domestic companies to stop foreign takeovers in order to safeguard <loc>Germany</loc>’s prosperity.
