 ECONOMIST Andrea Hosso argued against the Irish “hostage” backstop and insisted that the EU must realise a Brexit deal with a backstop won’t pass through Parliament.
During an interview with Sky News’ Adam Boulton and Lord Liddle, economist Andrea Hosso reflected on a no deal Brexit and emphasised the importance of Brussels now realising that they are holding the <loc>UK</loc> “hostage” with the backstop in the Brexit agreement. Theresa May has gone to <loc>Brussels</loc> today in hopes of reopening negotiations on the backstop issue. The economist and investment specialist said: “To hold a whole country hostage to something like this.

“It is something that the country has to weigh it up.
“The <loc>UK</loc> had a referendum, the <loc>UK</loc> said we want to leave the European Union, the majority vote was to leave the EU.”
Lord Liddle then interrupted at this point to say that the majority of <loc>Northern <loc>Ireland</loc></loc> didn’t vote to leave to which the economist responded: “Maybe not, but <loc>Northern <loc>Ireland</loc></loc> and Scotland are part of a country and the country had a referendum.”
She continued: “The different nations component of the country needs to decide.

“Do we accept the countries majority vote and we keep faith with that or we have to think about our future.
“It is a very hard thing I do realise but can you see any other solution.”
Adam Boulton also spoke on the potential drawbacks of a no deal Brexit and whether Brexiteers were asking for too much from the European Union.
The economist responded: “I don’t think Brexiteers are asking for the impossible.
“They are asking for a mutually good trading relationship, there is nothing impossible about that.
“I think <loc>Brussels</loc> has reached a point where they have to think long and hard about this whole relationship.
“So far for two years, they have been expecting the British Remain camp to have enough influence
“And now they have reached a point where they realise Parliament is not willing to go along with anything so they will have to give way.
“Now whether they are going to do it today probably not, they will probably come up with a fig leave for Theresa May to pass what she wants to pass.
“Whether that will be acceptable for Parliament or not I am not sure.
“Because people are very worried about the backstop clause, I call it the hostage clause because that is what it is.”
