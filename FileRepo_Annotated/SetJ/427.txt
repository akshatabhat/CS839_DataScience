 Job vacancies in the <loc>United States</loc> climbed to an all-time high in December, signalling extreme strength in the labour market. Available jobs stood at 7.3 million on the last day of December, up from 6.9 million at the end of November and far in excess of the 6.9 million forecast by economists, a report by the Department of Labor showed. When the labour market is at or close to full strength, it puts pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, because higher competition for workers normally leads to wage increases and ultimately inflation. However, wage gains have been relatively weak for several years and inflation has not risen as much as economists expected. There have been more <loc>US</loc> job vacancies than unemployed workers for ten consecutive months. At the end of December, there were 800,000 more jobs available than unemployed workers, yesterday's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey and last month's Employment Situation Summary suggest. American employers took on 5.9 million staff in December, meaning that the gap between job vacancies and jobs filled that month was 1.4 million. Non-farm staff employed increased for a record 100 month in a row in January, by 304,000. CREDIT: James Dean <loc>US</loc> Business Editor
