 <loc>China</loc>'s move away from market-oriented reforms has undermined the country's economy, and <loc>Beijing</loc> must reverse course soon to prevent a tailspin, a prominent <loc>US</loc> economist has warned.
The resurgence of <loc>China</loc>'s state sector followed a series of supportive measures to make them bigger and stronger, which sidelined the private sector, ­argues Nicholas Lardy, a ­senior fellow at the Peterson ­Institute for International ­Economics who has written about the Chinese ­economy and financial sector for four decades.
In his latest book - The State Strikes Back: The End of Economic Reform in <loc>China</loc>? - Lardy also ­suggested mainland officials ­address the long-standing ­grievances of its trading partners on industrial policies and state subsidies.
In a key Communist Party ­document in late 2013, leaders vowed to allow market forces to play a decisive role in ­resource ­allocation, Lardy said.
But the reality was a shrinking private economy sector and an expanded role for state enterprises whose managers "appear to be asset maximisers, borrowing ever larger amounts to expand their business even if the returns do not cover the cost of capital", he said.
The share of bank lending to state firms more than doubled from 2013 to 2016, while private firms had been squeezed out, he said. But the productivity of state players was steadily lower than private-sector rivals.
"The resumption of state-led growth, in which a growing share of resources is flowing into investment by relatively low-product­ivity state firms, and an increasingly omnipresent party are contributing to <loc>China</loc>'s growth slowdown," Lardy said in his book. "The fast growth of ­investment by more productive private firms before, which was boosting <loc>China</loc>'s growth, has now moderated due to a combination of political factors and 'crowding out', inevitably slowing <loc>China</loc>'s growth."
<loc>China</loc> has moved further away from the double-digit growth it was experiencing, including a high of 10.6 per cent in 2010. Its economy grew 6.6 per cent last year, the lowest increase since 1990.
"Whether this change is transitory or persistent will depend on policy," Lardy said.
His sentiments were echoed by Chinese government advisers who are pessimistic about the economic outlook, particularly when <loc>Beijing</loc> is facing a growing blockade of its tech investment in the global market and louder criticism of its strong hand in hampering market competition.
The advisers shared the view that the reforms in recent years ­intended to reduce the debt load of state firms or make them competitive and efficient had yet to ­revitalise growth.
<loc>Beijing</loc> reintroduced a debt-for-equity swap plan to reduce the debt loads, ordered the shutdown of "zombie" firms and began a mixed-ownership programme that allows private businesses to take equity stakes in state firms.
"The fundamental obstacles to implementing far-reaching economic reforms in <loc>China</loc> is the top leadership's view that, while state-owned firms may be a drag on <loc>China</loc>'s economic growth, they are essential to maintaining the position and control of the Community Party and achieving the party's strategic objects," Lardy said.
<loc>Beijing</loc>'s fear of financial and social instability and the opposition of vested interest groups - ­including top management of large state firms, some government bureaucrats and many local officials - were also obstacles for market-oriented reform, he said.
Lardy said the number of ­underperforming state companies that went bankrupt was "tiny" ­because of widespread ­resistance at the local level and the "state- ­orchestrated" mergers had, in reality, reduced competition and created new monopolies. He said local governments relied on tax income from companies, even zombie companies - which have long-term losses but still keep operating - to finance social services and local infrastructure.
A return to market reforms should include lowering barriers for more productive private firms; encouraging bottom-up mergers and acquisitions to let private companies to take over underperforming state firms; and taking forceful measures to retire zombie firms, mostly state-owned, he said.
Lardy estimated that the ­deteriorating productivity of state-owned enterprises and the decrease in private investment ­reduced <loc>China</loc>'s growth by an estimated 1.6 to 2 percentage points annually.
