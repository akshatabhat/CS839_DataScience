 Consumers' outlook for the <loc>U.S.</loc> economy rose in early February as American households absorbed the end of the government shutdown and the Federal Reserve's decision to pause its rate increases.
The University of <loc>Michigan</loc> said Friday its consumer-sentiment index was 95.5 this month, up from 91.2 in January. January's reading had been the weakest since October 2016.
Although consumers were more optimistic now that the longest shutdown on record is over, they continued to feel its lingering effects and worried about the possibility of another shutdown, said Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist.
While the majority of respondents still expect the Fed to raise rates this year, that proportion fell to the smallest level in two years, he said.
Consumers' long-term inflation expectations also fell to their lowest level in a half century, Mr. Curtin said. That suggests consumer spending will remain strong in 2019. Mr. Curtin said he expects personal consumer expenditures will rise 2.7% this year compared with a 2.2% increase for the overall economy.
"The data suggest that the Fed will find it even harder to justify another rate hike given the record low inflation expectations," Mr. Curtin said.
The Fed in January indicated it would pause its rate increases for the time being, a turnaround from its December projection of two rate increases this year. The Fed raised rates four times in 2018.
