 <loc>WASHINGTON</loc>â€”<loc>U.S.</loc> industrial output fell sharply in January, primarily driven by a large drop in vehicle production.
Industrial production, a measure of factory, mining and utility output, decreased a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in January from the prior month, the Federal Reserve said Friday . Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal, however, had expected a 0.1% gain at the beginning of the year. Despite the unexpected one-month decline, industrial production rose 3.8% in January from the prior year.
Last month's stark production drop was driven, in part, by a precipitous decline in vehicle output. Vehicle assemblies fell in January from a two-year high in December, the Fed said, signaling part of the drop could simply be pullback from an unsustainable pace of output growth in that category.
Still, production in most other major durable goods categories, including electronic equipment and wood products, also declined. Output in nondurable good categories, such as apparel items, was flat.
Output at all <loc>U.S.</loc> factories for all product areas declined 0.9% in January, and mining output ticked up 0.1%. Utility production rose 0.4% from December. The manufacturing industry's output accounts for about 75% of the nation's total industrial output.
Capacity utilization, which reflects how much industries are producing compared with what they could potentially produce, fell to 78.2% in January. Capacity utilization has remained below long-run averages. Economists had expected 78.7%.
At the moment, economic data implies the <loc>U.S.</loc> economy should be poised to support solid growth in the industrial sector. The low unemployment rate and continued solid jobs growth has helped spur faster wage growth for workers, which should, in turn, support demand. The government also ramped up its defense spending in 2018, buying more manufactured goods.
But a few economic uncertainties have made their way to the fore recently. Analysts are increasingly worried that recent trends in global industrial output, and a slowing global economy more broadly, will eventually filter into the <loc>U.S.</loc> manufacturing industry.
The "latest [manufacturing] surveys show that global manufacturing conditions have continued to deteriorate, and <loc>U.S.</loc> producers are unlikely to remain immune to this slowdown," analysts at Capital Economics, an economics consulting firm, said in a release to its clients Thursday.
Moreover, the latest retail sales data from the Commerce Department showed consumers unexpectedly reined in their spending at the end of last year.
