 The <loc>United States</loc> is poised to see its longest period of economic growth since 1785, if there is no recession before July, according to Marie Owens Thomsen, global head of investment intelligence at Indosuez Wealth Management.
Tariff increases from its trade war with <loc>China</loc> are unlikely to tip its economy into recession, as long as trading volume keeps growing, she said. The previous longest <loc>US</loc> expansion was 120 months, between March 1991 and March 2001. By July, the current economic upcycle will have lasted 121 months.
"One thing that is protecting us from a recession is that although we are talking about higher tariffs, they are rising from a record low level," she said. "Even if they double the tariffs, they will still come nowhere close to our historical experience."
In 2017, tariffs amounted to just 1 per cent of all imports to the <loc>US</loc> and 5 per cent of its dutiable imports, far lower than an average of 60 per cent in the early 1930s, when the <loc>US</loc> suffered from a long and deep economic depression.
Global trade volume growth slowed from 4 per cent in 2017 to an estimated 2 per cent last year, said the economist, who also forecast global economic growth to decelerate to 3.2 per cent this year and 3 per cent next year from 3.4 per cent in 2018 and 3.6 per cent in 2017.
Owens Thomsen's comments stand in contrast with those of ­Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman, who on Sunday told Bloomberg TV that the <loc>US</loc> "seems pretty likely" to see a recession in the next two years, a view shared by most <loc>US</loc> chief financial officers in a Duke ­University survey published in ­December 2018.
Krugman said lack of consumption in <loc>China</loc> and weak growth in <loc>Europe</loc> were the biggest risks to the global economy. <loc>Italy</loc>, the third-largest economy in the euro zone, slipped into recession in the final quarter of last year.
Owens Thomsen said the broad macroeconomic environment was still supportive of ­continued global growth and that the sharp correction in equity markets late last year did not ­reflect that.
"Surrounding the growth figures, we also have very low interest and inflation rates … the [capital market] price actions we saw in December were very ­divorced from macroeconomic reality and that's why we were still reasonably positive at the time, and we also have a reasonably positive outlook for this year," she said.
She expected the <loc>US</loc> Federal Reserve to raise interest rates twice more this year, after its ­surprise comment last month that it would not raise interest rates for at least a while, in a change from a previous bias ­towards tighter monetary policy.
"The <loc>US</loc> economy is still ­expanding, just at a lower pace, and inflation has been and probably will be over target," Owens Thomsen said.
"As long as inflation is over the 2 per cent target, they must have a tightening bias."
Meanwhile, she said it was "hard to be bullish" on the yuan given that <loc>China</loc>'s current ­account surplus had fallen to zero, but <loc>Beijing</loc> would not let it ­become too weak to avoid capital outflows, which would destabilise its economy.
