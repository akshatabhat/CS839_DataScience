 SIR - When will William Hague and others recognise that the concept of the Burkean MP does not apply to Brexit?
MPs asked the electorate what to do and they were told. It is their duty to uphold that decision. Those who voted Remain, or are critical of the Government’s actions, hold legitimate positions. However, flagrant sabotage is unacceptable and should earn the wrath of constituency parties.
Furthermore, with the proposed Brexit Party looking to split the vote, those MPs will become an electoral liability anyway. Does anyone expect the Tories to hold Broxtowe?

SIR - William Hague does not think Nick Boles should face deselection “because of his efforts to prevent a no-deal Brexit”.
  He is either naive or has not been paying attention, since it is clear to the rest of us that Mr Boles’s real aim is to derail the Brexit process completely, so that <loc>Britain</loc> remains in the <loc>EU.</loc> This is the polar opposite of what most of his constituents voted for. In such circumstances they are perfectly entitled to deselect him, and I hope they succeed.

Brexit concern rivals some of the most serious crises in recent history
SIR - For some time I have been wondering who on earth to vote for at the next general election.
I have voted Tory all my life, but could not do so again. Theresa May has been the most incompetent prime minister we have ever known, and the party is divided between Remainers like Philip Hammond, who are trying to sabotage the referendum result, and Brexiteers like Boris Johnson, who are afraid to declare their true ambitions.
Nor, of course, could one vote for a Marxist who has befriended enemies of this country and has got rid of his moderate colleagues. Then there are the Liberal Democrats - but I could hardly vote for a man who blamed Brexiteers for “shafting young people” and displaying an “undercurrent of violence”.
I was therefore delighted to learn of the Brexit Party, and sincerely hope that it can be more successful than the Referendum Party or Ukip, which had similar agendas but, due to internal squabbling, did not realise their goals.

SIR - The Brexit Party is gaining strong support from voters, on the Left and the Right, who seek true representation. There is a yearning for government that is decisive and delivers what the electorate demands.
Nigel Farage must take the initiative and assemble a team of people - including some already active in Parliament, but also new men and women of integrity and relevant experience - who can formulate a set of policies covering all areas, not just Brexit. They must be ready to assume the mantle of leading <loc>Britain</loc> forward.

Benefits of free trade
SIR - Jeremy Warner acknowledges the gains to the economy and the consumer from free trade, but argues that it would be a “nightmare” because it could put plants such as Port Talbot out of business via a collapse in the car industry.
This is far too pessimistic. We at Economists for Free Trade, the pro‑Brexit advocacy group, have looked at that industry and found that Brexit will make it far more profitable, once you factor in the Brexit exchange rate adjustment. Furthermore, the productivity growth of which the car industry has shown itself to be capable will be the main way in which it will respond to what is simply a continuation of the competition it has already faced from globalisation.
Competition in general is the consumer’s and the economy’s friend, as the lower prices pressurise industries into raising productivity. Why shy away from the competition generated by free trade? The taxpayer is there to help industries we want to preserve for wider reasons, such as the environment. We can do that while still encouraging the good effects of competition.
Brexit brings large gains to the economy from the free trade it permits us to pursue. With full employment now a by-product of our flexible labour market, we should let these gains flourish, confident that employment will be robust as productivity responds.

Trade | Read more from The TelegraphHow a law to permit assisted dying would work
SIR - Last week I travelled to Dignitas in <loc>Switzerland</loc>, where Geoffrey, my dear husband of more than 50 years, died in my arms in order to avoid the ravages of end-stage motor neurone disease.
I am fully aware that people will hold a range of views on assisted dying. However, there are several objections I wish to make to Charles Moore’s take .
Mr Moore, whom I have followed for many years, is rightly concerned about the impact that any change in the law could have on vulnerable people. But Mr Moore was not present at Portcullis House the week before Geoff died, where he spoke to parliamentarians and made it quite clear that he would not support any change that did not put in place robust safeguards.
The law my family is calling for would ensure - through two independent doctors and a High Court judge - that only those who are in the final phases of a terminal illness and are of sound mind and settled intent could request an assisted death. Dignitas required detailed medical reports and several capacity assessments. Even the final act has to be controlled by the individual - my husband had to swallow the medicine through a straw, entirely unaided by anyone else.
Assisted dying | The facts
Mr Moore’s suggestion that Geoff could have avoided the police intrusion in our lives had he “decided to live” is ridiculous. Geoff’s illness had already taken that choice away from him. He simply wanted to go on his own terms, and as his wife I would do anything to support his final wish. My actions were under investigation, not his. To have seen Geoff suffer against his wishes for several more weeks, if not months, would have been unimaginably worse.
I also take issue with Mr Moore’s assertion that exposing cases like Geoff’s conveys a “message of despair” to others facing terminal illness. Mr Moore’s brother-in-law felt able to endure the immense suffering he faced, but Geoff did not and that does not make him any less “brave and honest”. Knowing that Geoff could die in the way he wanted to allowed us to cope with his illness and make the most of the time we had left with him. To me, Geoff’s decision was just as “inspiring” and it did not devalue his final months or years in any way.
If places like <loc>Oregon</loc> in the <loc>US</loc>, for instance, can put the necessary hurdles in place to protect the weak and vulnerable, and provide the option only for specific cases, surely it is not beyond the means of the lawmakers in this country to follow their example.

About | DignitasUnprepared for war
SIR - We would need to increase the mass and lethality of our Armed Forces twentyfold if <loc>Britain</loc> were to take on the Russians or the Chinese . Currently our Army has about 76,000 soldiers, of whom 18 per cent are undeployable because of their poor fitness.
We cannot operate globally any more. We should instead concentrate our efforts on Nato and other allies, and sharpen up our home defence capability with shore-based anti-air and anti-ship missiles. Our under-escorted carriers would not survive long in a hot war.

How the <loc>UK</loc>'s defence personnel breaks downFood for thought
SIR - One of our students has just won the George Pickering prize, awarded for the candidate receiving the highest marks in <loc>Oxford</loc> University’s medicine finals and the prize vivas.
One of Somerville’s academics recently made a breakthrough discovery concerning the molecular structure of the brain. Another has used mathematical models to map the polarisation of Italian politics.
I could go on, but you get my drift. Yes, we have taken octopus off the menu at the first formal meal for Freshers, as you reported . We are also looking at expanding our provision of halal and kosher food, and perhaps adding a few more meat-free options as well. We are taking these steps because we would like our students and staff to feel included and comfortable at meal times, and I am glad that your newspaper is taking such a keen interest in our menu planning.
However, the college of Margaret Thatcher and Dorothy Hodgkin will always be a place that puts intellectual excellence and the pursuit of knowledge above everything else.

Farmers quite rightly set great store by silage
SIR - Dave Alsop (Letters, February 9) thinks that the Countess of <loc>Wessex</loc> went “above and beyond the call of duty” by judging a silage competition.
It seems he does not appreciate the importance of maintaining standards in animal care during the winter months. I suspect the Countess of <loc>Wessex</loc> does.

Smart meter hard sell
SIR - After incessant hounding from my energy provider about a “smart” meter, I responded explaining why I didn’t want one. I received an email in January 2018 saying that I would not be troubled further.
Recently, however, I started receiving letters again. Again, I emailed to complain and repeated that I did not want a smart meter.
On Monday evening, I had a phone call apologising, but was told that I could only be taken off the contact list for a year. The pestering would then recommence. The caller also said that these devices will be made compulsory. If this is true, it is yet another betrayal by our Government.

Smart metersSlow to go
SIR - Alan Mottram (Letters, February 9) reports that signs near his home warning of new traffic lights ahead have been in place for two years.
Near my home are signs about a “new” 30mph speed limit that have been in place for 15 years. The county council has stated that there are no plans to remove them.

A musical education
SIR - I am a rowing coach working in a school and I can vouch for the continuing popularity of the “old” music hits .
In the 15 years since I started coaching teenage boys, one song has consistently featured in their workout playlists: Britney Spears’s Hit Me Baby One More Time, which was in the charts well before they were born.
This works both ways. I doubt very much that Disclosure or Martin Solveig would have featured on my playlists if I hadn’t heard them in the gym first. Coaching millennials has broadened my musical tastes - although it has also played havoc with my Spotify algorithms.

Hat trick
SIR - I know very well when to wear my trilby (Letters, February 12) .
It is when I go shopping with my husband. I am under 5ft tall, so trolleying around a supermarket without it causes problems, as he can never find me. It also helps that it is brilliant red.
