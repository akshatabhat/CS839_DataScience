 <loc>BEIJING</loc>—<loc>China</loc>'s exports surprisingly accelerated last month, suggesting a pickup in global demand for Chinese goods after a drop-off late last year.
Exports surged 9.1% from a year earlier in January, according to data from the General Administration of Customs released Thursday. January's rise reverses a 4.4% decline in December and beat the expectations of many economists, who had forecast another decrease.
Imports, however, dropped for a second consecutive month, though the 1.5% decline last month compared with January a year ago is less steep than December's 7.6% drop and smaller than many economists projected.
January's better-than-expected performance, economists said, likely came in part from exporters hurrying out orders ahead of February's Lunar New Year holiday and before the cease-fire in the <loc>U.S.</loc>-<loc>China</loc> trade war expires on March 1. "Today's data are indeed much stronger than we had expected," said Shuang Ding, an economist at Standard Chartered.
Negotiations between <loc>U.S.</loc> and Chinese officials under way in <loc>Beijing</loc> this week are trying to resolve the yearlong trade dispute that has rattled global markets and seen both countries' place tariffs on goods that account for about 60% of their trade. The <loc>U.S.</loc> has said it would raise punitive tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods on March 2 to 25%, from 10%, unless the two sides reach an agreement.
January's trade data showed that while <loc>China</loc>'s trade surplus with all trading partners stood at $39.16 billion—much smaller than the $57.06 billion surplus recorded in December—the surplus with the <loc>U.S.</loc> moderated less, reaching $27.3 billion, compared with $29.87 billion in December.
"The <loc>U.S.</loc> won't probably be comfortable with today's bilateral data," Mr. Ding said. In particular, he pointed to a 41.2% on-year drop in Chinese imports from <loc>U.S.</loc>
<loc>China</loc>'s exports to the <loc>U.S.</loc> fell 2.4% from a year earlier in January, compared with a 3.5% decline in December, the customs data showed.
Chinese officials have promised to step up purchases of <loc>U.S.</loc> farm and energy products in bilateral trade talks. <loc>Beijing</loc> also lowered its tariffs levied on some <loc>U.S.</loc> goods.
