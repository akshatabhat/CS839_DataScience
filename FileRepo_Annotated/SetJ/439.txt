 MILLIONS of households gained more respite on living costs today as inflation fell below the Bank of <loc>England</loc>'s 2% target for the first time in two years. The Consumer Prices Index stands at 1.8% for January, falling sharply from December's 2.1%, according to official figures. The deceleration was driven by the introduction of the price cap on standard variable tariffs last month, triggering the biggest fall in gas and electricity costs for more than 30 years. Another fall in petrol prices added to the downward pressure. With wages now growing at their fastest pace for a decade, at 3.3%, real-terms pay growth is also moving higher. The Institute of Directors' senior economist Tej Parikh said: "For the past two years, households have been squeezed between high prices and weak wage growth. With inflation now at a two-year low and growing upward momentum in pay packets, consumers are likely to feel less of a pinch on their wallets. This easing in the cost of living should provide some uplift for the High Street just as consumer confidence appears to be waning." Inflation has fallen more sharply than the Bank expected thanks to a slump in oil prices since last autumn. In November, it predicted the CPI would average 2.2% in the first quarter of 2019 but now forecasts the inflation rate staying below target for the rest of the year. The news offers some relief after a run of dire economic news, including the slowest growth for the <loc>UK</loc> since 2009 last year. But there were also warnings that the respite could be temporary. Energy regulator Ofgem said last week that the price cap will rise by 10% in April — likely to boost inflation by 0.3 percentage points — while supplier npower put up its bills today. "It is welcome news for households, but a further substantial fall isn't likely," Pantheon Economics' chief <loc>UK</loc> economist Samuel Tombs said. In the short term the outcome of the Brexit talks is driving the monetary policy committee's stance on interest rates, although the Bank is nervous about rising <loc>UK</loc> pay growth feeding into inflation. ING Bank's James Smith said: "Amongst the short-term Brexit warnings, the Bank of <loc>England</loc> still hinted last week that mounting domestic inflationary pressures could require a faster pace of tightening than currently anticipated by markets. This is one reason why we don't think a rate hike should be ruled out just yet this year." @russ_lynch This easing in the cost of living should provide some uplift for the High Street just as consumer confidence appears to be waningTej Parikh, Institute of Directors CREDIT: economics Russell Lynch
