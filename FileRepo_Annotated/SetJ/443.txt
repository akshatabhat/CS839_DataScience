Theresa May has sought to play down reports that she will face MPs with a stark Brexit choice between her deal and delaying Brexit just a few days before March 29, after her top civil servant was overheard outlining the plan in a bar.
Speaking in the House of Commons, Mrs May told MPs not to pay heed to "what someone said to someone else as overheard by someone else, in a bar".
  "It is very clear the government's position is the same. We triggered Article 50 (the process by which the <loc>UK</loc> leaves the <loc>EU</loc> )... that had a two-year time limit, that ends on the 29 March."
She added: "We want to leave with a deal, and that's what we are working for."
As there is no majority support for a 'no deal' scenario in the House of Commons, it is likely that an extension to Article 50 will be requested in March anyway if MPs continue to refuse to back the deal.
It came as Olly Robbins, the Prime Minister’s chief Brexit negotiator, was rebuked by the Brexit Secretary, who warned that the <loc>UK</loc> cannot extend Article 50 into the “darkness”.
Stephen Barclay has attempted to pour cold water on suggestions that Theresa May is running down the clock in order to force MPs to vote for her deal.
Distancing himself from Mr Robbins this morning, Mr Barclay said that Mrs May remains “committed to leaving on 29 March” and that seeking an extension was not Government policy.
It comes after Mr Robbins was thrust into the spotlight on Tuesday evening, after he reportedly claimed that MPs will be presented with a choice between Mrs May’s deal or a lengthy delay.
He was overheard in a hotel bar by an ITV reporter telling colleagues that "in the end" <loc>Brussels</loc> will "probably just give us an extension" to Article 50 .
He suggested the Prime Minister will try to win support for her deal by warning MPs that if they fail to vote for it the delay to Brexit is likely to be a "long one".
Brexit | The best commentary
His comments were seized upon at Prime Minister's Questions by Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminister leader, who claimed Mrs May had been "rumbled" by her "loose-lipped adviser".
Mrs May attempted to play down the controversy, telling MPs that she wants a deal and the reports were "something said by someone else, overheard by someone else".
Asked about the comments earlier this morning, Mr Barclay also claimed they were “second hand” remarks which were only partially heard in a “noisy bar”.
He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The reality is that we are committed to delivering on the deal. The Prime Minister has been very clear that we are committed to leaving on the 29 March.”
Mr Barclay also insisted that <loc>Brussels</loc> would be highly unlikely to grant an extension without a clear reason for doing so, adding that delaying Brexit would be “very disruptive” ahead of the European Parliament elections.
“Any extension is not a unilateral decision,” he added. “In the meetings with many of the European leaders that David Lidington and I had, what came over was actually that it is not in anyone's interests to have an extension without any clarity.
"They have obviously elections for the Parliament and a Commission that will be formed at the end of May, so there is no desire on the European side to see what one described to me as an 'extension in darkness', where there is no clarity as to why we are extending."

   Michel Barnier has some sobering words for <loc>EU</loc> countries this evening as he confirms there is still no movement on the vexed question of the Irish border from the <loc>UK</loc>.
The lack of a compromise emerging this week, despite Mr Barnier meetings his British counterpart Steve Barclay for dinner in <loc>Brussels</loc> earlier this week, will fuel speculation that the Prime Minister is simply running down the clock.
  <loc>EU</loc> Council President Donald Tusk, speaking after a Brexit talks update meeting with Michel Barnier in <loc>Brussels</loc> this evening: ‘No news is not always good news. EU27 still waiting for concrete, realistic proposals from London on how to break Brexit impasse.’

5:03PMERG to rebel?
It appears the ERG may vote against the Government tomorrow on a motion which, they fear, would remove 'no deal' from the negotiating table and therefore considerable leverage,
In practice, however, it's all just theatre. The motion in question approves a non-legally binding, and therefore toothless, amendment which stated that the House of Commons should avoid a 'no deal' scenario.
NEW: I’m told representatives from the ERG are meeting the chief whip to urge to the Govt to amend the motion otherwise ERG support cannot be guaranteed

4:45PMBrexit migration report retracted
Migration Watch <loc>UK</loc> has retracted a report on post-Brexit immigration levels.
It claimed net migration to the <loc>UK</loc> could increase by more than 100,000 under the Government's proposed new immigration system.
On Wednesday, the organisation - which describes itself as an "independent and non-political think tank" - said: "We have decided to withdraw the paper issued today on post-Brexit migration levels.
"There was an error in the calculations which was unfortunately overlooked at the final stages of preparation.
"We apologise for the error and will rectify it in the course of producing a revised version."
The statement did not give details of which figures are affected by the error.
The Home Office had earlier contested the report's claims, describing them as "inaccurate and untrue".
3:21PMDowning Street: No deal still an option
Downing Street has denied that Theresa May is taking a no-deal Brexit off the table.
   Eurosceptic Tories are threatening to rebel in a key Brexit vote on Thursday over a motion tabled in the Prime Minister's name which they claim would commit her to avoiding <loc>EU</loc> withdrawal without a deal.
The motion asks the House to reiterate its support for the approach agreed on January 29, when the Commons backed an amendment authorising Mrs May to go back to <loc>Brussels</loc> to renegotiate the controversial Irish backstop.
But members of the backbench European Research Group say that it effectively endorses another amendment approved by MPs the same day, which rules out no-deal but is not binding on the Government.
One ERG member told the BrexitCentral website: "We told the Government very clearly last night that we will not support this motion and in fact we urged them, indeed pleaded with them at senior level, to withdraw it yesterday - but they took absolutely no notice. Frankly, we despair."
Mrs May's official spokesman told reporters at a <loc>Westminster</loc> media briefing: "What the motion reflects is the position the Prime Minister set out after those votes, which is the Parliament wants the <loc>UK</loc> to leave with a deal, but in order to do so it requires us to secure legally-binding changes in relation to the backstop."
2:35PMJammy Brexit planning
Steven Swinford in <loc>Westminster</loc> reports:
During a Cabinet discussion on food waste on Tuesday the Prime Minister revealed that she scrapes the mould off old jam and eats the rest.
The Prime Minister's Official spokesman said that whether they scrape mould off the top of jam or chuck it away is a "matter for the individual".
Jeremy Cobyn's spokesman said that the Labour leader's "love of making and consuming jam is well known" and as such it "never gets to the stage of scraping or chucking.
2:34PMVideo: Why Mark Carney swapped fear for hope12:48PMPM backs free licences for over-75s
Labour MP Rosie Cooper asks Mrs May if she agrees that the BBC must maintain free licences for the elderly.
Mrs May responds: "I recognise the value that people across the country place on having a television, and for many elderly people the connection that brings with the World. That is why the free licences for the over-75s are so important.
"We have been clear that we want and expect the BBC to continue free licences when they take over responsibility for the concession in 2020. Taxpayers rightly want to see the BBC using its substantial licence fee income in an appropriate way to ensure it delivers fully for <loc>UK</loc> audiences."
12:44PMLabour MP says deal would pass if PM promises a public vote
Peter Kyle said that the withdrawal agreement could secure a majority in the Commons if Mrs May agreed to offer a public vote on it first.
She gives the idea short shrift, adding that her views on a second vote remain unchanged.
12:33PMTory MPs demand clarity on Brexit position
Henry Smith, a Conservative MP, asks Mrs May to clarify reports this morning that the Government believes an extension of Article 50 is likely and to rule out a customs union.
She says the <loc>UK</loc> must have an independent trade policy. She also downplays the reports this morning about her chief Brexit negotiator, describing it as "'something said by someone else overheard by someone else".
12:25PMSNP challenges May over Robbins' comments
Ian Blackford, the <loc>Westminster</loc> leader of the Scottish Nationalists, says that the Prime Minister has been "rumbled by your own loose-lipped adviser", a reference to Olly Robbins, who has been thrust into the spotlight over claims that MPs will face a choice of the deal or an extension of Article 50.
He asks her whether she will now confirm she is seeking to delay Brexit.
   She hits back by pointing out he could provide certainty to business by backing her deal, adding that the Scottish independence his party seeks would mean <loc>Scotland</loc> leaving the <loc>EU</loc> on no deal terms.
12:22PMMay hits back at Labour's Brexit ambiguity
Mrs May says that Jeremy Corbyn has decided to focus his questions on Chris Grayling to avoid bringing up Brexit, which his own party is fiercely divided over.
She the country does not know the Labour leader backs a referendum, a deal, of if he even backs Brexit.
"People used to say he was a conviction policy, not anymore," she adds to cheers from the Tory backbenches.
12:19PMCorbyn attacks Chris Grayling over 'no ships' ferry firm
Jeremy Corbyn kicks off PMQs by asking Mrs May about Seaborne freight, a company he says "with no ships and no trading history".
He says Mr Grayling had assured the House they were up to the task, but now that contract has failed, he wants to know "what went wrong?"
Mrs May dodges the question and says the remaining contracts, accounting for 90 percent of the money allocated, are still in place.
She insists proper due diligence was carried out.
Mr Corbyn responds by pointing out the National Audit Office spent £800,000 assessing the bid. He adds that the contract was "high risk" and asks why Mr Grayling proceeded in the knowledge of this.
Theresa May asked again to rule out extending Article 50. She doesn't.
She dismisses Olly Robbins reports as 'something said by someone else overheard by someone else'. Says she wants a deal.
- Steven Swinford (@Steven_Swinford) February 13, 2019
The Prime Minister says that under Mr Corbyn's argument no start-up would be viable for government contracts, adding that the contracts important for no deal planning.
Mr Corbyn cites a freedom of information request, claiming that Mr Grayling breached normal rules by preventing a group of experts and lawyers to scrutinise Seaborne.
Mrs May says no money was paid to the contractor. She adds that the Labour leader has stood up "time and time again" and opposed spending on no deal, which she claims is irresponsible.
Mr Corbyn says Eurotunnel's decision to challenge the contracts in the High Court will cost the taxpayer £1m.
Mrs May just reverts back to her claim that Mr Corbyn is not prepared to spend money preparing for no deal. He says she could prevent it simply by taking no deal off the table.
12:00PMShadow Brexit minister: businesses are pulling their hair out
Jenny Chapman, a shadow Brexit minister, says businesses are "pulling their hair out" over the lack of certainty being provided by the Government.
She says it is unacceptable that a government which prides itself on being the party of business is failing to provide assurances to companies up and down the country.
Trade minister Jesse Norman says it's a bit rich for Labour to accuse the Government of failing to provide certainty when it is refusing to vote for a deal that offers it.
11:33AM<loc>Scotland</loc>'s chief economist issues no-deal warning
A no-deal Brexit would lead to a "major dislocation" to the Scottish economy, according to the country's chief economist.
In a State of the Economy report published on Wednesday, <loc>Scotland</loc>'s chief economic adviser, Gary Gillespie, indicated that disruptions to logistics, supply, trade, investment, migration and market confidence could cause a "significant structural change in the economy".
   The analysis suggested that although the country had experienced a "positive year" economically, with growth in areas such as exports and high labour market performance, uncertainty around the <loc>UK</loc>'s withdrawal from the <loc>EU</loc> remained a "live risk".
The report highlighted business activity softening towards the end of 2018, with business confidence also becoming weaker - attributed to growing uncertainty over Brexit.
  It also pointed to forecasts that the Scottish economy is expected to grow by between 1% and 1.5% over 2019, although indicated that these would need to be reconsidered in the absence of an orderly departure from the <loc>EU</loc> .
   The <loc>UK</loc> is expected to leave the <loc>EU</loc> on March 29, however Prime Minister Theresa May has not been able to gain sufficient support from MPs to support her deal.
10:01AMSir Keir Starmer insists 2nd referendum is still on the table
 The Shadow Brexit Secretary has insisted the "only credible options" left for Labour are a "close economic relationship" with the <loc>European Union</loc> or a "public vote".
Speaking amid an ongoing row over the party's Brexit strategy, Sir Keir refused to comment on reports that a reference to a referendum was removed by Jeremy Corbyn's office before his letter to the Prime Minister was sent.
It was reported last week that Sir Keir had helped draft the letter, which is said to have originally contained a reference to a public vote, but that this was removed without his knowledge.
  Asked about the controversy this morning, he told the Today programme: "The letter set out the close economic relationship in detail, it was credible, it's been well received in the <loc>UK</loc> and the <loc>EU</loc> .
"We made absolutely clear the next day - I said so, Jeremy Corbyn sent an email to all members - that a public vote is an option still on the table."
   Reacting to comments reportedly made by Olly Robbins, Sir Keir added: "What the Prime Minister is up to is obvious. She's coming to Parliament every other week, pretending there's progress and trying to buy another two weeks, edging her way towards March 21, when the next <loc>EU</loc> summit is, to try to put her deal up against no-deal in those final few weeks.
"Parliament needs to say 'That's not on'."
Asked whether he would vote for Mrs May's deal over a no-deal if it came to a division days before the March 29 deadline for Brexit, Sir Keir said: "No, I think at that stage there would be a concerted effort to force the Prime Minister to seek an extension of Article 50 and I think that would get a majority in the House."
9:40AMBrexiteers attack Robbins over Article 50 comments
Unsurprisingly, Tory MPs and Brexit campaigners are less than impressed with the comments attributed to Olly Robbins overnight.
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns tweeted: "If true, the PM should stop ignoring the wishes of the British people and disregarding her own red lines."
Nigel Farage, former Ukip leader, said Mr Robbins was part of the "Civil Service fifth column" and called for him to be sacked for his combination of "treachery and incompetence".
However Steve Baker, the deputy chairman of the pro-Brexit Tory European Research Group, said it was the view of the Prime Minister which counted.

"Officials advise. Ministers decide. If the PM decides we are leaving on March 29, deal or no deal, that will happen," he said.
A Downing Street source said: "Look at the facts. We are doing everything we can to get the meaningful vote delivered by the end of February.
"Parliament has set out very clearly that it wants this to be resolved by then. The Prime Minister wants this over and done by March 29." Downing Street declined to comment on "alleged remarks from a private conversation".
