 World sugar production is expected to decline in the 2018/19 season after it had shown a steady increase in the last three years, according to an industry economist.
Paul Makube, a senior agricultural economist at FNB, said this week that world sugar production was expected to decline by 4 percent year-on-year (y/y) during the 2018/19 season after a steady increase in the last three years.
"Cane sugar production, which accounts for close to 80 percent of that total world sugar production, is expected to decline by 5 percent y/y to 143.98 million tons," he said.
Makube added that the countries that would see the most declines were Thailand and Brazil, with a 6 and 21 percent drop respectively in production y/y. In the US, overall production (cane, beet, etc) was expected to decline by 3 percent y/y, but the cane category to increase slightly by 1 percent y/y to 3.67 million tons in the 2018/19 season.
The drop could be attributed to a number of factors, which included relatively softer prices due to higher production costs last year that discouraged commitment to plant.
"Poor production conditions in some of the major producing areas were also cited as the reasons for the decline," Makube said.
For the South African industry, while the sugar production has enjoyed protection through a dollar-based reference price tariff system, the combination of lower international prices and a stronger exchange rate continued to make it more attractive to import sugar.
Makube said that although South African growers were under pressure from imports, this protection offered industry players an opportunity to be competitive on the local market.
