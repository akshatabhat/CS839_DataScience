 German business is seriously worried about the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Scarcely a day passes without a new warning from business leaders. The car industry trade body, the VDA, says no-deal could have "fatal" consequences, while the Federation of German Industry (BDI) says it would be a disaster that could cause a "massive crisis".
 But, despite the alarm, so far German business has remained solidly behind the negotiating position of Angela Merkel and the <loc>EU</loc> 27. There is no sign of the carmakers pressuring the chancellor to cave to British demands in order to safeguard their exports, as Brexiteers have long predicted. Rather, much of the German business community appears to view the likelihood of no-deal as the result of British intransigence.
"A chaotic Brexit is getting dangerously close," says Joachim Lang, the BDI directorgeneral. "Businesses on both sides of the English Channel are hanging in the air. The priority must be to avoid a hard Brexit. British politics has to live up to this responsibility.
 "The cohesion of the <loc>EU</loc> 27 is the top priority for the German industry. We support the EU's negotiating line. The ball is in <loc>London</loc>'s court."
 Despite its rejection by the House of Commons, Mr Lang describes Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement as "the best possible outcome of negotiations for both the <loc>EU</loc> and the <loc>UK</loc>" and rejects any attempt to renegotiate it. "The already ailing German-British trade figures show further uncertainty about the process is poison for the economy," he says.
Britain had a trade deficit with <loc>Germany</loc> of £21bn, out of a total trade volume of £134bn, in 2017. As Mr Lang says, Brexit is already having an effect. German exports to the <loc>UK</loc> fell by more than €1bn (£878m) in 2017 compared with the previous year, and <loc>Britain</loc>, once <loc>Germany</loc>'s third-largest market, slipped to fifth place.
