<loc>Germany</loc>’s gross domestic product (GDP) remained flat in the fourth quarter of 2018, meaning the country has narrowly dodged a recession, according to preliminary data released by the Federal Statistics Office (Destatis).
There was zero growth compared to the third quarter, and 0.6 percent compared with the same quarter in 2017, Destatis said in a statement on Thursday.
A decline of 0.2 percent in the third quarter of 2018 had raised fears of a technical recession, which is defined by two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth.
 Destatis said that the fourth-quarter stagnation was mainly down to a cooling global economy and trade tensions between the <loc>United States</loc> and other countries. <loc>Britain</loc>’s looming exit from the <loc>European Union</loc> and the risk of it leaving without a deal is another uncertainty.
ING’s chief economist Carsten Brzeski cited “the trade conflict between the <loc>US</loc> and <loc>China</loc>, Brexit or the lack of investment in digital and traditional infrastructure, delays of railways and airlines as well as hardly any significant new structural reforms” as reasons for the stagnation.
As a result of zero growth in the fourth quarter, Destatis was also forced to revise down its overall 2018 GDP growth estimate from 1.5 percent to 1.4 per cent, the weakest growth rate in five years and markedly slower than the previous year.
<loc>Germany</loc> is one of the world’s largest exporters, so the health of its economy is seen as an indicator of the state of the global economy.
The German government recently slashed its growth forecast for 2019 from 1.8 percent to 1 percent, citing global trade tensions and a slowdown in the global economy.
But Commerzbank’s chief economist Joerg Kraemer said he does not expect economic growth to continue to stagnate, citing domestic consumption, “which until recently - unlike in past economic downturns - has remained robust.” “The labour market is strong, consumers’ willingness to spend at its highest level since April last year, order books are still richly filled and companies still report assured production close to record highs,” Brzeski said.
