 BRITAIN'S economy has stalled due to the paralysis over Brexit, Philip Hammond admitted yesterday. The four major sectors — services, agriculture, manufacturing, construction — shrank as firms sat on cash. With 45 days to Brexit and no deal in place, analysts say bosses are waiting to what happens with the talks before investing. Official figures showed output declined 0.2 per cent December. The economy grew a disappointing 1.4 per cent over the year — the lowest since 2012 — after a slump in the final three months. Experts believe the figures for also be grim. January will Chancellor Mr Hammond economy was being "overshadowed" by uncertainty over Brexit. He said: "The sooner we resolve that, the quicker get back to more growth in the future." Theresa May's spokesman insisted the economy "remains fundamentally strong". Even so, say analysts, the figures will add to the pressure on the PM to cut a Brexit deal with the EU. Despite business leaders' fears, she will ask MPs for another two weeks to talk to Brussels in a bid to reach reassurances on the Irish backstop. Meanwhile, it was confirmed yesterday that business investment 3.7 per down on a year ago. Tej Parikh, economist at the Institute of Directors, said Brexit worries had seen firms hold back and "engage in cautionary stockpiling". Ben Brettell, senior economist financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said concerns over global trade would also have played a part. t.newtondunn@the-sun.co.uk CREDIT: By TOM NEWTON DUNN Political Editor CAPTION: Economy woes . .
