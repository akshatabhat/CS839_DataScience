 In a restaurant in the backstreets of <loc>Beijing</loc>, 12 Pakistanis and Afghan­s studying at the <loc>China</loc> University of Communications tell stories of their arrival in <loc>China</loc>.
No one came to pick them up; none of them spoke a word of Chin­ese. They have plenty of tales of getting lost, disoriented and ripped-off by taxi drivers.
The students, all but two of them ethnic Pashtuns, roar with laughter as they swap yarns and savour the cuisine from <loc>Xinjiang</loc>, a Chinese region that borders on their home countries and has cultur­al bonds with them.
Any ill-feeling about those early days has long since dissip­ated. They agree that, apart from some taxi drivers, the Chinese are very helpful. Friendly relations betwee­n their countries and <loc>China</loc> mean they are welcomed as brothers.
Most important, they are all on full scholarships — free tuitio­n, free accommodation and a stip­end of 3000 yuan ($615) a month, more than three times Pakistan’s GDP per person. <loc>­Beijing</loc>’s many <loc>Xinjiang</loc> restaurants serving halal food are a big plus.
There are nearly half a million foreign students in <loc>China</loc>, about half of whom are on degree prog­rams. South Koreans are the most numerous. They often come to <loc>China</loc> if they cannot get into good universities at home — unlike Americans, who come out of cultural and political curiosity, and because it looks good on their CVs.
But the share of students from the developing world is growing fast, especially from the dozens of countries such as <loc>Pakistan</loc> and <loc>Afghanis­tan</loc> that have signed up to <loc>China</loc>’s Belt and Road Initia­tive, a global infrastructure-­building project.
Overall numbers of foreign students grew fourfold in 2004-16; student numbers from BRI-relate­d countries expanded eightfold. In 2012, the year before the BRI was launched, students from those countries on Chinese governme­nt scholarships were less than 53 per cent of the total number of recipients. By 2016, they made up 61 per cent.
<loc>China</loc> says it reserves 10,000 of its scholarships every year for stud­ents from BRI countries. Local governments have been pilin­g in with their own “Silk Road scholarship” schemes.
In countries such as <loc>Britain</loc>, <loc>Australia</loc> and <loc>America</loc>, foreign students are welcomed mostly becaus­e universities can make more money out of them than out of ­locals.
In <loc>China</loc> it is the opposite. Foreign students enjoy big subsidies. Often they are more generously treated than local students. Last year, the Ministry of Education budgeted 3.3 billion yuan for them, 16 per cent more than in 2017. The rich world is selling education. <loc>China</loc> is using it to buy influence.
The cheerful Pashtuns are one manifestation of <loc>China</loc>’s strategy. Another are the more than 500 Confucius Institutes the government has set up on campuses around the world.
Offering heavily subsidised classes in Mandarin, the institutes have aroused suspicions in the West that <loc>China</loc> may be using them to exert political influence. Such worries have prompted sever­al universities in <loc>Europe</loc> and <loc>America</loc> to close them. There has been far less resistance to <loc>China</loc>’s stepped-up efforts to bring stud­ents to its own territory and, it hopes, to influence them there.
It is a familiar path among aspirin­g superpowers. Just as Cecil Rhodes endowed the Rhodes Scholarships a century ago to preach British imperial virtues, the <loc>US</loc> set up the Fulbright prog­ram in 1946 to spread American values and the <loc>Soviet Union</loc> created Patrice Lumumba University in 1961 to teach socialism to ­stud­ents from third-world countries, so <loc>China</loc> is using higher education for political ends.
One of its aims is to strengthen ties with BRI countries. Global Times, a state tabloid, paraphrased a former Chinese envoy to <loc>Iran</loc> (a BRI participant) as saying that studying in <loc>China</loc> would help peopl­e to understand <loc>China</loc>’s pol­itical system and avoid “ignorant Western bias” against the country.
For many of the foreign stud­ents, a cheap degree is the main attractio­n. Several of the ­Pakistanis tried, but failed, to get European, North American and Australian scholarships; getting a degree at home would be much costlier than the one the Chinese are offering.
And the <loc>China</loc>-<loc>Pakistan</loc> Econom­ic Corridor, a huge BRI-related project in <loc>Pakistan</loc>, means jobs are plentiful there for those with Mandarin. Bilal, one of the Pashtun students, says that when he was returning to <loc>China</loc> from a visit home, he was offered two jobs while waiting at <loc>Karachi</loc> airport.
For many of the students, ­language is a problem. Some ­universities have created English-medium courses — Richard Coward of <loc>China</loc> Admissions, a firm that helps students find university places, knows of 2000 such programs — but many students have to use Chinese and few speak it well. That is difficult for teachers.
“The government and the universities don’t want the foreigners to fail, but as the number has increased­, the quality has fallen,” says Shuiyun Liu, of <loc>Beijing</loc> Normal University.
There is some grumbling among young Chinese about the ease with which, in spite of this, foreigners walk into good universities and about the superior facil­ities they are sometimes offered.
Foreign students have reserv­ations, too, says Ms Liu, who has researched foreigners’ satisfaction with teaching in <loc>China</loc>.
“The rules are all hidden here,” she says. And the relationship betwee­n teacher and pupils is differen­t. “There’s not much critical thinking. Students are not alway­s encouraged to challenge the teachers.” Learning in <loc>China</loc> can be an endurance test. Lectures commonly go on for three or four hours, with only a 10-minute break. “This morning I fell asleep after three hours,” one of the Pakistani students says.
That said, students from developing countries tend to be more enthusiastic than students from the West. “The culture is ­amazing,” says Ugochukwu ­Izundu, a Nigerian who did a ­master’s degree­ in data analysis at Xi’an ­Jiaotong Liverpool University in the eastern city of <loc>Suzhou</loc>. “I believe <loc>China</loc> is a force for good in the world,” says Goodwill Mataranyika, a Zimbabwean at Shijiazhuang Tiedao University in <loc>Hebei</loc>, a northern province. “The Belt and Road Initiative is an economic corridor for mutual benefit, and <loc>China</loc> is also investing in <loc>Africa</loc> for a shared win-win bene­fit for all nations.” (<loc>Nigeria</loc> and <loc>Zimbabwe</loc> are signatories to BRI.) For all such talk, personal relations between the foreigners and their Chinese fellow-students often remain distant. The Pakistanis and Afghans speak warmly of the friends they have made from other countries, but they do not have any Chinese ones.
“I would try to talk to them,” says Bilal, who did his degree in Chinese. “But when we did group assignments, they would make their own groups, and the foreigners would be left to work together. I don’t know what it is. Maybe they’re shy.” Still, Bilal has no complaints. He has married a Brazilian he met in <loc>China</loc> and now works in the Pakistani embassy in <loc>Beijing</loc>. “I got a scholarship, a language, a job and a wife. God smiled on me.”The Economist
