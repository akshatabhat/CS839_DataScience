In logic, a paradox is an apparently contradictory conclusion that is derived from what seems to be valid premise. Many paradoxes are based on false premises or arguments underlying the logical systems involved. Most petro states have many paradoxes based on incomplete presumptions. A petro state is one whose governmentâ€™s income is deeply reliant on the export of oil and natural gas. Their economic and political powers are highly concentrated in an elite minority, and political institutions are weak and unaccountable, and corruption is widespread. Economists believe that petro states are afflicted by the Dutch Disease. In an afflicted country, a resource boom attracts large inflows of foreign capital, which leads to an appreciation of the local currency and a boost for imports that are now comparatively cheaper. It sucks labour and capital away from other sectors of the economy, such as agriculture and manufacturing, which economists say are more important for growth and competitiveness. As these labour-intensive export industries flag, unemployment could raise and the country could develop an unhealthy dependence on the export of natural resources. In extreme cases, a petro state forgoes local oil production and instead derives most of its oil wealth through high taxes on foreign drillers. Petro state economies are then left highly vulnerable to unpredictable swings in global energy prices and capital flight.
