 <loc>BRITAIN</loc>’S departure from the EU’s economic and customs union shows there would be a negative impact if <loc>Scotland</loc> left the <loc>United Kingdom</loc> with a predicted annual loss of £10 billion, a leadingScottish economist has suggested.
Professor John McLaren, for theScottish Trends website, said: “The Brexit-related arguments that the break-up of an economic and customs union will result in a negative impact on future economic growth – due to increased tariff and non-tariff barriers – are also valid in the case of Scottish independence from the <loc>UK</loc> economic union.
“However, the degree to which this impact might be greater or lesser than for Brexit remains a matter for debate.”
Mr McLaren said it was “widely accepted that <loc>Scotland</loc> would be deprived of a net transfer, in the region of £10 billion, from the rest of the <loc>UK</loc> in the event of independence”. This, he argued, was in contrast to the <loc>UK</loc> leaving the EU, where the impact was likely to be “small but positive,” although this would be negative once longer term, slower growth impacts were considered.
Mr McLaren, former <loc>UK</loc> Treasury economist, who lectures on public policy at <loc>Glasgow</loc> University’s Business School, also suggested that the Brexit debate showed that if <loc>Scotland</loc> voted to become independent, then this was likely to lead to a “plethora of options” for what independence might actually mean.
He explained: “This ranges from an old-style nation-state to remaining in some form of political and economic union with both the EU and the <loc>UK</loc>.
“A bespoke arrangement with both bodies seems likely to result in the most advantageous – or least detrimental – outcome in economic terms.”
This, Mr McLaren, argued this might involve an independent <loc>Scotland</loc> having membership of the European Economic Area similar to <loc>Norway</loc> or being part of a British economic union, similar in form to the current EU in terms of being an area of shared political sovereignty and economic co-operation among its member nation states.
“Such a ‘British Union’ might allow for the use of sterling, no trade barriers and some degree of continuing fiscal transfer,” he suggested.
The academic said that while, as with Brexit, the first economic impact of such changes to the political and economic landscape around a second referendum might have little influence on the electorate, the second fiscal impact was more likely to affect, negatively, voting intentions.
This, he suggested, in turn might make it more likely that an “alternative form of independence” was proposed which helped ameliorate some of these impacts.
Willie Rennie, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said: “This report should make clear to the Nationalists that independence would only worsen the economic chaos of Brexit.
“Straight away, independence would mean almost £10bn per year less for public services. A lower rate of economic growth will further eat away at cash for the NHS and education. Rather than stomp their feet, the SNP should face the facts: breaking up is hard to do.”
An SNP spokesman said: “Brexit poses a massive economic threat to <loc>Scotland</loc> and, combined with Westminster’s shambolic handling, it is making the case for independence stronger by the day.”
