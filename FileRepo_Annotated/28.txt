 THE EU's hardline stance on Brexit was challenged last night as German economists warned that Brussels might not have the upper hand. They said the Irish backstop should be torn up and called for more flexibility to preserve friendly ties with the UK. A report by the influential Ifo Institute and universities across Europe said Brussels must 'abandon its indivisibility dogma' on the EU's four freedoms - the free movement of goods, capital, services and labour. It warned that Brussels may be deluding itself in thinking that the EU has the upper hand or that the UK will capitulate before March 29. 'In a standard game of chicken, the actor who loses the most will dodge first. Can the EU really be sure that losses are sufficiently asymmetrically distributed that it "wins" this game?' the report asked. 'We call on the UK Government and the EU Commission to rethink their "red lines" and return to the negotiation table.' The report added: 'Since 2000, the UK paid a net contribution to the EU budget of 76bn euros. One may argue that this fact alone merits a fair treatment of the second-largest European economy.' Meanwhile, ministers became embroiled in a Twitter row with Donald Tusk yesterday after he claimed Theresa May had not been clear about what she wanted. Tory deputy chairman James Cleverly called the European Council President's comments 'ridiculous', and Liz Truss, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: 'On Tuesday Parliament was clear. We want the Prime Minister's deal plus changes to the backstop. Over to you.' CREDIT: By Claire Ellicott Political Correspondent
