The entity we chose to extract was academic papers and specifically papers from the Computer Vision field.

Our sources were as follows :
1. arxiv.org : It is an automated electronic archive (preprints) for research articles
2. openaccess.thecvf.com (cvpr) : Repository for the Open Access versions provided by Computer Vision Foundation of papers submitted to CVF sponsored conferences (CVPR and ICCV)

We intend to check for overlaps between CV papers in arxiv and the papers accepted in the CVF conferences.
