5:21PMMarkets wrap: FTSE 100's best run in 10 months ended by eurozone woes and Trump disappointment
The FTSE 100 snapped a six-day winning streak after another shock slowdown in German factories fuelled fears that the eurozone is sliding towards recession.
German factory orders growth slumped 7pc year-on-year in December, the biggest drop since 2012, as dwindling foreign demand pulled the sector into contraction territory for a second straight month. Economists had expected monthly growth to enjoy a modest rebound but its decline accelerated, sinking 1.6pc.
The woeful data from Germany's large industrial sector added to mounting fears of stumbling growth in the eurozone. A PMI survey for the currency bloc revealed yesterday that the slowdown has extended into 2019 with growth edging down to its lowest level in more than five years.
ING economist Carsten Brzeski warned that the figures suggest the slump in German factories "gained new momentum towards the end of the year". The recent build-up of factory inventory indicates that any rebound in its manufacturing sector in the coming months will be "slow and sluggish", he added.
The DAX, Germany's blue-chip stock index, led the move lower on European markets, dropping as much as 0.6pc. The FTSE 100 snapped a six-day winning streak, its best run since April, after Donald Trumpâ€™s State of the Union address underwhelmed investors.
