 MUMBAI, Feb. 8 -- India's central bank unexpectedly cut interest rates on Thursday, along with an anticipated change in its policy stance to neutral, citing easing inflation and the need to sustain growth in the world's fastest growing major economy.
The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy committee (MPC) cut repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.25%. Only eight of the 38 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected the central bank to effect a rate cut. Banks, however, remained ambiguous about passing on the benefit to borrowers.
The rate cut, the first such move by RBI since August 2017, comes as the central bank trimmed its retail inflation forecast for the first half of the next fiscal and marginally lowered its economic growth estimate to 7.4%. The monetary stimulus, announced in governor Shaktikanta Das's debut policy meeting, will aid the government in boosting economic growth.
"The shift in stance from calibrated tightening to neutral provides flexibility to address, and the room to address, sustained growth of India's economy over the coming months as long as inflation remains benign," Das told reporters after the meeting.
While the decision to change the policy stance was unanimous, the six-member committee was divided over the decision to cut rates. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Pami Dua, Michael Patra and RBI governor Das voted in favour of a rate cut, while Chetan Ghate and RBI deputy governor Viral V. Acharya were in favour of keeping the policy rate unchanged.
The decision to cut rates comes a week after the Narendra Modi government announced an expansionary budget ahead of national elections that are due by May.
Thursday's changes by RBI come on top of liquidity expansion. It has already pumped in Rs.2.36 trillion through open-market operations and promised to inject an additional Rs.37,500 crore in February.
