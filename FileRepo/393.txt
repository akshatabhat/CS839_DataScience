 From forecasting to avoiding errors in geopolitical calculation, a proper study of history can be a good guide to the future
One of the things I like about living in Singapore is the optimism - the honest confidence that tomorrow will be better than today. There's a belief that everything can and will be remade, and remade better.
The contrast with present-day Europe could not be more stark. It's invigorating.
But one issue with constantly looking to the future is that it can lead you to underestimate the utility of the past. Singaporeans are proud of their past but, at the moment, it seems history is mainly used to bolster or contest a sense of identity. The debate over 1819 and how much significance can or should be read into Stamford Raffles' landing is a good example.
Although questions of identity are clearly very important, if overemphasised, they can turn history into a morass of bad-tempered and unwinnable cultural arguments. Meanwhile, the prejudice that history "is the reciting of facts" remains quite deeply embedded.
The problem with both these dominant points of view is that they miss many of the ways in which history can make a practical contribution to the future. Over the past few years, Singapore has made considerable investment in history and the humanities, yet the opportunities that this investment opens up are not widely understood. There is still little sense that history has anything practically useful to contribute to the task of shaping tomorrow. But it does.
PREDICTING THE FUTURE At the most basic level, historical research can improve the models which we use to predict the future. To give a dramatic example, climate scientists have turned to the ship logbooks of the English East India Company because by making use of the observations recorded by 17th-century sailors, they can build a long-term understanding of climate change.
