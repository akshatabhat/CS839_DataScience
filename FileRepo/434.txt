 It was a blue Christmas for retailers, with sales well down last December - the second consecutive month of decline.
Takings at the till were 6 per cent below those of the same month in 2017, a far sharper fall than the 3.6 per cent slide forecast by economists in a Bloomberg poll.
It was also the biggest year-on-year sales drop since January last year, when takings fell 7.7 per cent.
The full-year numbers for last year were a little better, with sales down 0.7 per cent from 2017, although turnover registered a slight increase of 1.1 per cent if motor vehicles were stripped out.
Car sales last December took the biggest hit, as they did last November, tumbling 20.7 per cent year on year.
Excluding motor vehicles, retail turnover declined 3 per cent.
Besides motor vehicles, all but one retail category saw lower year-on-year turnover.
