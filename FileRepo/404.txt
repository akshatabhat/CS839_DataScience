 NATIONAL <loc>Australia</loc> Bank economists can no longer foresee a time when the Reserve Bank will raise the cash rate, joining those who believe there could be a cut this year.
Economists at the bank said yesterday they no longer expected the RBA to raise rates in late 2020, a prediction they made late last year.
“We … now expect the cash rate to remain on hold over the forecast horizon,” the bank’s economists told investors.
“While our central case is for the cash rate to remain on hold, based on the balance of risk, the next move could well be down, potentially as soon as (the next half).” The RBA has kept the cash rate at an all-time low of 1.5 per cent since August 2016, but last week shifted from a bias towards rate rises to a more neutral stance. NAB’s economists said signs pointed to weakness in the Australian economy, especially in retail spending, as consumers faced significant issues. “In particular, we see ongoing slow wage growth, falling savings rates, high debt levels and falling house prices as ongoing headwinds,” NAB said.NAB shares closed 14¢ lower at $24.21 yesterday.
