 India's bond market reacted sharply to the finance minister's announcement of higher-than-expected fiscal deficit for the coming year and the corresponding borrowing burden on the market saw 10-year bond yields jump 11 basis points to close at 7.38%.
Net borrowing, after adjusting for repayments, is seen at ?4.48 lakh crore in FY20 almost unchanged from ?4.47 lakh crore as per the revised estimate for FY19.
Gross borrowings were expected to be lower than ?7 lakh crore, but have been pegged at ?7.1 lakh crore, an increase of 24% from ?5.71 lakh crore in FY19.
While the slippage in fiscal deficit in FY19 from 3.3% to 3.4% was expected, the fiscal deficit figure of 3.4% for FY20 came as a surprise.
"The borrowing number is way beyond expectation because most people were expecting the fiscal deficit figure of 3.3% for FY20," said an economist, requesting anonymity.
The high borrowing numbers pushed up the 10-year bond yields to 7.39% on Friday against its previous close of 7.28%.
"The financing of pegged budget deficit appears to be through larger-than-expected market borrowing (net) for both FY19 and FY20. The bond markets have reacted to this news adversely. The bond yields have moved up by 11 bps from today's lows," said Shubhada Rao, Chief Economist, Yes Bank.
In September 2018, the government had cut its gross borrowing for the year by ?70,000 crore and stuck to the net borrowings planned in the budget to meet the fiscal deficit target for the year and cool bond yields.
There is an increase in repayments for FY20 at ?2.36 lakh crore compared with ?1.48 lakh crore in the current fiscal.
"A 12% rise in net borrowing by the government is likely to add pressure on bond yields but improved global liquidity scenario due to the US Fed's dovishness will make bond yields move in a narrow band," said India Ratings' chief economist Devendra Kumar Pant. "However, if there is fiscal slippage and growth slips or there is an upward trajectory of inflation, it may lead bond yields to spike," Pant added.
