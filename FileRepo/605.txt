 Companies will have to rely less on foreign workers and become more productive if the service sector is to remain competitive.
That has led to the Dependency Ratio Ceiling - the proportion of foreigners on work permits or S Passes a firm can employ - being cut from 40 per cent to 38 per cent on Jan 1 next year, and to 35 per cent on Jan 1, 2021.
The quota for S Pass workers - mid-skilled foreigners paid at least $2,300 a month - will drop from 15 per cent to 13 per cent on Jan 1 next year, and to 10 per cent on Jan 1, 2021.
The last quota reductions for the sector were in 2013.
Firms that already exceed the new levels will have to meet the quotas when applying for permit renewals.
Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat said the decision to reduce the quota was done "after much deliberation".
Although some companies - such as those in manufacturing - have done well to deploy staff efficiently, service segments such as retail and food and beverage remain very labour-intensive, he added.
Growth in the number of S Pass and work permit holders in services has been picking up pace. It rose by about 3 per cent a year, or 34,000 in the past three years.
Indeed, the increase in the number of S Pass holders in services last year was the highest in five years.
Economic transformation is critical. We expect to spend $4.6 billion over the next three years on the new and enhanced economic capability-building measures in Budget 2019, and to support Singaporean workers. $3.6 billion will go towards helping our workers... $1 billion will go towards helping firms build deep enterprise capabilities.
