 A UNITED Ireland would be less costly than previously thought, claims an economist who helped reunify Germany. Brexit has led to increased speculation about a 32-county Republic with Sinn Fein demanding a border poll. And surveys show people are more open to the idea than ever before while even PM Theresa May admitted the UK "union will only endure" if there is no hard border on this island. It had been widely believed unification would cost £9billion as a united Ireland would have to find the cash to cover the British subvention. With three million people working on the island, that leaves a potential cost of €3,467 per taxpayer. But that figure has been rubbished in a report compiled by Fianna Fail senator Mark Daly and Gunther Thumann, a senior IMF economist during the reunification of East and West Germany at the end of the Eighties. Looking at Ireland, Thumann found the deficit would "come close to a balanced budget" and be as low as £699million or £232 per employee. And according to Thumann's research, Ireland would not pick up the £2.8bn pension bill. Instead, that would still fall to the British because the money was paid into schemes before the North and South came together. Senator Daly said: "The demographic shift in Northern Ireland also shows there will be a nationalist voting majority by 2023/2024. So we have five years to plan."
