 As the output gap closes, wages will start rising in rural areas as well. This will put pressure on food inflation from both the demand and supply side
When headline and core inflation diverge so sharply-as is the case in India at the moment-the key question is which eventually converges to which? Does headline eventually converge to core? Or does core converge to headline? With India's headline inflation below 3% and core inflation at almost 6%, the directionality of convergence matters crucially and will determine the outlook of inflation and monetary policy in 2019. There are good theoretical reasons, a priori, for the directionality to run either way. If core inflation were to begin asymptoting towards that, markets will start pricing in an easing cycle. In contrast, if headline inflation starts converging to core inflation, talk of rate hikes will be back on the table. The purpose of this piece is not necessarily to ask why food inflation has decelerated so much. Or what sticky core inflation is telling us about output gaps. It is simply to use India's inflation history to ask a narrower, more technical, question. What does past data tell us? Does headline inflation eventually converge to core? Or does core revert to headline?
To answer this question, the standard approach followed by Cecchetti and Moessner (2008) and Anand, Ding and Tulin (2014) is utilised and monthly CPI inflation data (year-on-year growth rates) commencing in 2002 is used. In the baseline data, CPI-IW (industrial workers) is used because that enables a longer time series. Then, running the same analysis using the new CPI combined series starting in 2011, the results don't change. For CPI-IW, core inflation is defined as headline adjusted for food and fuel. A finer distinction is not available due to data constraints. In the case of CPI combined, core is defined as headline adjusted for food, fuel, housing, and transport or communication.
