 PROPERTY NEW-HOME building permits have fallen for the second month running to a five-and-a-half year nadir, as credit tightens and house prices continue to slide.
Building and renovation approvals, seasonally adjusted, fell 8.4 per cent over December adding to a slide in November, figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics yesterday show.
Approvals are now down 22.5 per cent over the past year.
The update was released just hours before the final report from the financial services royal commission was made public and ahead of the Reserve Bank’s first meeting of the year today.
An almost 20 per cent drop in the apartment sector in December was the main factor driving total approvals to their lowest levels since June 2013.
“Today’s report makes for another sobering review of residential construction forecasts for the next year or two,” National Australia Bank senior economist David de Garis said.
Housing Industry Association economist Tim Reardon said “punitive” foreign investment tax rates, a record supply of apartments and continued credit squeeze was taking its toll. “We’ve long been anticipating the current downturn in new home building, but there is a risk it could develop more quickly and strongly than expected,” he said.Property researcher CoreLogic last week said house price falls in Sydney and Melbourne appear to be accelerating and the decline could be larger than the one following the GFC.
