5:03PMMarkets wrap: Construction sector growth stumbles to 10-month low on Brexit impasse
The Brexit impasse has been blamed for derailing the construction sector's recovery after growth spluttered to a 10-month low in January.
Construction companies cited Brexit uncertainty for the sharp pullback in growth to its lowest level since the 'Beast from the East' brought the sector to a standstill last March. IHS Markit's PMI index slid to a score of 50.6 last month from 52.8 (any reading above 50 indicates growth).
The industry "only needs a small nudge to tip it closer to recession", warned Duncan Brock at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply.
Commercial work declined for the first time in 10 months while civil engineering activity dropped off sharply following December's 19-month high. Housebuilders continued to be the sector's strongest part.
Pantheon Macro economist Samuel Tombs said that the construction sector recovery has been "snuffed out" by the uncertainty, adding that a no-deal Brexit would send the sector sliding back into recession.
4:47PMDiesel's death is part of the Nissan storyEurozone car production
Changes to emissions standards for vehicles following the "dieselgate" scandal have had a profound impact on the European car industry.
Germany's Bundesbank blamed the shift in regulation for a marked slowdown last year that caused the country's economy to shrink by 0.2pc in the third quarter. While it is unlikely that diesel's woes were the sole cause for the German slowdown, the gear shift in car manufacturing in the wake of new emissions regulations has been considerable.
These issues are once again in the spotlight after Nissan said it would not build its most-commonly diesel-powered X-Trail model at the company’s Sunderland plant .

The gloomy economic backdrop has encouraged traders "to cash in their positions" this afternoon, says David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets.
He gave his take on this afternoon's sluggish action:
"The US-China trade spat, the Italian recession and the uncertainty hanging over Brexit are all bubbling away in the background. Volatility has been low as there has been little in the way of news to trigger excitement."
The pullback in oil prices this afternoon has dragged the FTSE 100 into the red. The index is on course for a 0.1pc dip while eurozone stocks have shed 0.5pc.

The chemicals giant owned by Britain’s richest man, Jim Ratcliffe, has called on Government to rip up the shale industry’s “unworkable” regulations or face an “energy crisis”.
In a blistering attack on the Government’s energy policy Ineos accused ministers of using “slippery back door manoeuvres to end shale” including “absurd” earthquake limits imposed on shale gas developers.
It also warned Government that it was “betting the future of our manufacturing industry on windmills and imported gas”, which could cause “irreparable damage” to the UK’s manufacturing base.

3:00PMStagnant start in US as investors turn attention to Google results
Wall Street has taken its cue from European markets with a stagnant start to trading this afternoon.
The Dow Jones is stuck in flat territory after rising strongly for six straight weeks. Attention in New York is beginning to turn to Alphabet's results after the closing bell this evening.
Shares in Google's parent company have edged higher before the hotly-anticipated figures. Analysts are pencilling in a 21pc jump in fourth quarter revenue.

A cryptocurrency exchange is unable to pay $190m back to its clients after its founder died suddenly.
Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX cannot access the funds after the death of 30-year-old Gerald Cotten, according to a CoinDesk report.
It is believed that only Mr Cotten knew how to access the funds in "cold storage", which is used to protect the coins from hacking.

Ferrexpo may be forced to delay publication of its full-year accounts after its auditors opened an investigation into its payments to a charity.
The FTSE 250 iron ore miner revealed Deloitte was scrutinising “unexplained discrepancies” in bank statements at Blooming Land, a Ukrainian charity set up by Ferrexpo in 2013 to further its corporate social responsibility goals.
Ferrexpo’s most recent payment to Blooming Land was a donation of $9.5m (£7.3m) in the first half of last year.

The slump in investor confidence in the eurozone could be the first of more gloomy figures from the currency bloc.
Vanda Szendrei at Oxford Economics explains that Sentix's index is "the 'first mover' of all of the eurozone economic indicators" and has "continued to disappoint in February".
She added:
"As the Sentix index tends to set the tone for other surveys, the drop does not bode well for the coming PMI releases, particularly considering the weak manufacturing PMI readings in Germany, Italy and the eurozone last month."
There is one silver lining from recent eurozone growth indicators, however. Official GDP growth in the fourth quarter held up stronger than the miserable PMI survey scores. Eurozone growth stabilised at 0.2pc in the fourth quarter while survey indicators pointed to a slowdown.
12:24PMThe real reasons behind Nissan's U-turn on Sunderland
The main news this morning is the decision of Japanese car maker Nissan to not proceed with production of its new diesel SUV X-trail at its Sunderland plant. Not only is this decision important in itself but it is also being interpreted in terms of the Brexit debate. What should we make of it? Here I outline some of the key issues.
Problems in the auto industry, plus the new EU-Japan free trade deal that came into effect on 1st February are likely, in my view, to have been more important than Brexit in this decision. Although, uncertainty over Brexit, and indeed future UK policy, relative to the future policy environment in Japan will not have helped.

Flybe's biggest investor has won its bid to call an extraordinary general meeting on the future of the airline's chairman as it seeks to block a cut-price sale to Virgin Atlantic and Stobart Group.
London-based asset manager Hosking Partners, which owns almost a fifth of its shares, is seeking to oust chairman Simon  Laffin and appoint aviation executive Eric Kohn to conduct an investigation into the sale of Flybe.
Last month it wrote to Flybe’s board and City watchdogs to complain about the £2.2m sale of the airline to Connect Airways, a consortium including Virgin, Southend Airport-owner Stobart and investment firm Cyrus Capital Partners.

Investor confidence in the eurozone has slumped to its lowest level since 2014 as the region grapples with spluttering growth.
With Italy in recession and Germany suffering a sharp slowdown last year, Sentix's investor sentiment index slipped to -3.7pc, its lowest level since November 2014.
Sentix warned that "growth forces seem to be weakening dangerously quickly and strongly". It added that businesses being forced to enact Brexit contingency plans had also dampened the mood.
10:08AMOutlook for construction companies hinges on Brexit
UK Construction PMI missed expectations at 50.6 vs. Exp. 52.6
IHS Markit Key Findings:
- Slowest rise in business activity for 10 months
- Commercial work remains the weakest performing area
- Employment growth hit a two-and-a-half year low
- RANsquawk (@RANsquawk) February 4, 2019
The outlook for the construction sector hinges on the impasse in Westminster being resolved, according to Pantheon Macro economist Samuel Tombs.
He said that the recovery in the construction sector has been "snuffed out" by Brexit uncertainty.
A no-deal Brexit would send the sector sliding into another recession, Mr Tombs argued.
He added:
"But provided a deal is signed off, the construction sector likely will enjoy strong growth soon. Business investment should rebound later this year, given that firms' profit margins are relatively healthy and their balance sheets are awash with cash."

Construction companies suffered their worst month in January since the 'Beast from the East' brought the sector to a standstill last March.
The construction industry "only needs a small nudge to tip it closer to recession", said Duncan Brock at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply.
A score of 50.6 keeps the sector in expansion territory but the uncertainty in Westminster appears to be hampering British businesses. That weakness is likely to extend into February given the current Brexit impasse.
Commercial work declined for the first time in 10 months while civil engineering activity has dropped off sharply since December's 19-month high.
9:38AMBrexit angst grips construction sector as growth slows to 10-month low
Growth in the construction sector stumbled to a 10-month low in January as its recovery loses momentum amid Brexit angst.
IHS Markit's PMI index slid sharply to a score of 50.6 last month from 52.8 (any reading above 50 indicates growth). Construction companies blamed worries over the economic outlook for a broad decline across the sector.
"A number of survey respondents noted that Brexit uncertainty had led to hesitancy among clients and a corresponding slowdown in progress on new projects," IHS Markit warned.
9:23AMRyanair shares take another tumble after third quarter loss
Ryanair shares have taken another tumble after reporting a [Euro]20m (£17.5m) loss in its third quarter.
The budget airline suffered a tough 2018 and issued a pair of profit warnings in just four months. Higher fuel costs, lower fares and staff walkouts have weighed on its results.
"The most interesting news in these numbers is the fact the group doesn’t share the more upbeat outlook of competitors," said Laith Khalaf at Hargreaves Lansdown.
"Ryanair has said pricing pressure will continue into summer 2019."
Its shares have slipped back 4.5pc this morning, knocking more than £500m off its market value.

Markets are struggling for direction this morning after a flat start in Europe.
The FTSE 100 has eked out small gains in early trade but blue-chip indices on the Continent have edged lower.
Nonetheless, it has been a bright start to 2019 for markets. Global stocks have enjoyed their strongest start to a year in more than three decades. The rally has been fuelled by signs of trade talks progress and the Federal Reserve bowing to market pressure on interest rate rises.

8:38AMAgenda: FTSE 100 enters fifth day of gains, lifted by signs of resilient world economy
The FTSE 100 has extended its winning streak into a fifth day as markets edged higher on signs of resilient global growth and progress in trade talks.
Stocks in London were lifted by Friday's strong US jobs data brushing aside fears of slowing growth and Donald Trump hailing progress in trade talks with China.
The US president highlighted the bumper labour report in an interview with CBS and said there is a "good chance" of getting a deal on trade with China before a deadline in early March.
Mr Trump said he wanted a "fair deal" and said that Beijing had been"very helpful".
"We've put very massive tariffs on China. China is paying a big price and it's hurt China's economy very badly," the US president said.
The FTSE 100 inched 0.1pc higher to a fresh two-month high in early trade as the global rally slowed. Asian markets advanced while Eurozone stocks dipped 0.2pc.
