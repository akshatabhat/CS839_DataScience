Contrary to market expectation of a status quo, the Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee reduced its benchmark repo rate by 25 bps to 6.25 percent at its sixth bi-monthly policy review. As such, the reverse repo rate and the MSF rate now stand adjusted at 6.00%, and 6.50 percent respectively.
Four out of six MPC members voted for the rate cut, with the other two voting to keep the policy rate unchanged. The rate cut decision was accompanied by a shift in monetary policy stance to 'neutral' from 'calibrated tightening' earlier. This was not only on expected lines by market consensus, but also a unanimous thought process within the MPC.
Key takeaways
Inflation: The central bank lowered its CPI inflation trajectory to 2.8percent in Q4 FY19 and 3.2-3.4 percent in H1 FY20 vis-a-vis its earlier projection of 2.7-3.2percent in H2 FY19 and 3.8-4.2 percent in H1 FY20. It also introduced its CPI inflation forecast for Q3 FY20, which is pegged at 3.9 percent.
Growth: The central bank introduced its FY20 GDP growth forecast at 7.4percent (with risks evenly balanced), up from CSO's estimate of 7.2 percent in FY19.
Rationale for forecasts: The downward revision to the CPI inflation trajectory primarily reflects the "unprecedented soft inflation recorded across food sub-groups". This is along expected lines as India's food inflation has been persistently surprising on the downside in recent quarters. In addition, crude oil price has been more or less stable while few items within domestic fuel have turned soft.
