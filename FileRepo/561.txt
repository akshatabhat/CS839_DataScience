 Tomorrow, Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat will arrive at Parliament House to deliver his fourth Budget speech, setting the tone for Singapore's spending in the coming year.
The details are, of course, top secret. But Mr Heng has dropped plenty of hints over the past few weeks about what Singaporeans can expect.
In his words, the Budget will have a "comprehensive agenda", focusing on topics such as security, economic transformation and the details of the multibillion-dollar Merdeka Generation Package.
Analysts with an eye on Singapore's economic performance predict that Budget 2019 will be an expansionary one, with a projected surplus in government coffers for the 2018 financial year.
Some have also raised the possibility that this could be a pre-election Budget, adding that if so, there is "ample fiscal latitude to be more generous and further boost expenditure".
The next general election must be held by April 2021. Some people say it could be called this year.
DBS Bank senior economist Irvin Seah says the fiscal balance for the 2018 financial year is expected to register a surplus of $3.3 billion, compared with the previously expected deficit of $600 million.
