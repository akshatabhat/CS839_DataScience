 A rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India, which was seen as a certainty until Thursday, looks unlikely now thanks to the expansionary budget.
Economists said that by increasing spending and borrowing, the government will be boosting consumption and widening the fiscal deficit. This, in turn, will put a pressure on inflation, thereby reducing the headroom for the RBI to cut key interest rates.
According to Radhika Rao, economist with DBS Bank, RBI is likely to factor in the modest slippage in the fiscal deficit target at its February 7 monetary policy review. "Nonetheless, with the broader fiscal targets not deviating sharply from the consolidation path, we expect the RBI to prioritise its price stability mandate," she said. Next week's policy is likely to see RBI shift its stance from 'calibrated tightening' to a 'neutral' stance given that inflation has been benign. "We expect rates to be on pause in rest of 2019," said Rao.
Also many feel that the government has been highly optimistic in framing the fiscal deficit targets for next fiscal given the expenditure plan. "For fiscal 2020, divestment will need to be front loaded to achieve the ambitious target of Rs 90,000 crore and tax collections aggressively pursued. This will be important to keep government bond yields in check," said Dharmakirti Joshi, Chief Economist, Crisil.
"As far as RBI is concerned, we believe the Budget pushes back possibility of rate cut in near future and expect RBI to highlight potential upside risk to inflation because of slip in fiscal," said Akhil Mittal, senior fund manager (Fixed Income), Tata Mutual Fund.
