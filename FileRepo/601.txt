 Brian Monteith makes simplistic comparisons when he tells us that, since the financial crisis, the UK has grown 19 per cent compared to the Eurozone's 13 per cent (Perspective, 18 February). One reason this is not comparing like with like is that the countries of the EU have had the euro straitjacket.
After Brexit we have a tricky transition until we replace lost trade deals. So far interest in new trade deals has been muted - recently China and Japan accused the government of unprofessional negotiating. So projecting from past into future can be problematic as we are now in a different situation to EU countries. When Brian Monteith tells us we have a Â£96 billion deficit with the EU he makes it sound like the EU makes it too difficult for us to sell. Then he doesn't explain how. Perhaps it's just that our industries have low productivity with long hours and under-investment. He claims that the UK's is mainly a service economy. Beware generalisations which disguise how big our exports are to Europe and how closely dependent we are on links and European cooperation. Also, notice that services find it possible to trade within EU rules whereas WTO trade agreements don't help services to trade abroad.
He thinks fiscal transfers are a bad thing - eg from London to the north -but most economists argue that we actually need to invest in declining areas, infrastructure and training opportunities which can help us stimulate enterprise and global competitiveness. If fiscal transfers are such a bad thing perhaps he should actually explain why.
Once again I feel that Brian Monteith is saying: "Trust me, I'm a neoliberal. We know better than the academic economists."
